<p>At all of these events I want to share a vision for how we can enhance the ability of digital identity to enable trust while preserving individual privacy. This vision is what I call “Self-Sovereign Identity”.</p>
<p>Why do we need this vision now? Governments and companies are sharing an unprecedented amount of information, cross-correlating everything from viewing habits to purchases, to where people are located during the day, to where they sleep at night, and with whom they associate. In addition, as the Third World enters the computer age, digital citizenship is providing Third World residents with greater access to human rights and to the global economy. When properly designed and implemented, self-sovereign identity can offer these benefits while also protecting individuals from the ever-increasing control of those in power, who may not have the best interests of the individual at heart.</p>
<p>But what exactly do I mean by “Self-Sovereign Identity”?</p>
<h1>You Can’t Spell Identity without an “I”</h1>
<p>Identity is a uniquely human concept. It is that ineffable “I” of self-consciousness, something that is understood worldwide by every person living in every culture. As René Descartes said, <em>Cogito ergo sum</em> — <strong>I think, therefore I am</strong>.</p>
<p>However, modern society has muddled this concept of identity. Today, nations and corporations conflate driver’s licenses, social security cards, and other state-issued credentials with identity; this is problematic because it suggests a person can lose his very identity if a state revokes his credentials or even if he just crosses state borders. <strong>I think, but I am not</strong>.</p>
<p>Identity in the digital world is even trickier. It suffers from the same problem of centralized control, but it’s simultaneously very balkanized: identities are piecemeal, differing from one Internet domain to another.</p>
<p>As the digital world becomes increasingly important to the physical world, it also presents a new opportunity; it offers the possibility of redefining modern concepts of identity. It might allow us to place identity back under our control —&#0160;once more reuniting identity with the ineffable “I”.</p>
<p>In recent years, this redefinition of identity has begun to have a new name: <em>self-sovereign identity</em>. However, in order to understand this term, we need to review some history of identity technology:</p>
<h1>The Evolution of Identity</h1>
<p>The models for online identity have advanced through four broad stages since the advent of the Internet: centralized identity, federated identity, user-centric identity, and self-sovereign identity.</p>
<h1>Phase One: Centralized Identity <em>(administrative control by a single authority or hierarchy)</em></h1>
<p>In the Internet’s early days, <em>centralized authorities</em> became the issuers and authenticators of digital identity. Organizations like IANA (1988) determined the validity of IP addresses and ICANN (1998) arbitrated domain names. Then, beginning in 1995, certificate authorities (CAs) stepped up to help Internet commerce sites prove they were who they said they were.</p>
<p>Some of these organizations took a small step beyond centralization and created <em>hierarchies</em>. A root controller could annoint other organizations to each oversee their own heirarchy. However, the root still had the core power — they were just creating new, less powerful centralizations beneath them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, granting control of digital identity to centralized authorities of the online world suffers from the same problems caused by the state authorities of the physical world: users are locked in to a single authority who can deny their identity or even confirm a false identity. Centralization innately gives power to the centralized entities, not to the users.</p>
<p>As the Internet grew, as power accumulated across hierarchies, a further problem was revealed: identities were increasingly balkanized. They multiplied as web sites did, forcing users to juggle dozens of identities on dozens of different sites — while having control over none of them.</p>
<p>To a large extent, identity on the Internet today is still centralized — or at best, hierarchical. Digital identities are owned by CAs, domain registrars, and individual sites, and then rented to users or revoked at any time. However, for the last two decades there’s also been a growing push to return identities to the people, so that they actually could control them.</p>
<h2>Interlude: Foreshadowing the Future</h2>
<p>PGP (1991) offered one of the first hints toward what could become self-sovereign identity. It introduced the &#39;Web of Trust&#39;<sup><a href="#dfref-11" name="ref-11">1</a></sup>, which established trust for a digital identity by allowing peers to act as introducers and validators of public keys<sup><a href="#dfref-22" name="ref-22">2</a></sup>. Anyone could be validator in the PGP model. The result was a powerful example of decentralized trust management, but it focused on email addresses, which meant that it still depended on centralized hierarchies. For a variety of reasons, PGP never became broadly adopted.</p>
<p>Other early thoughts appeared in “Establishing Identity without Certification Authority” (1996), a paper by Carl Ellison that examined how digital identity was created<sup><a href="#dfref-33" name="ref-33">3</a></sup>. He considered both authorities such as Certificate Authorities and peer-to-peer systems like PGP as options for defining digital identity. He then settled on a method for verifying online identity by exchanging shared secrets over a secure channel. This allowed users to control their own identity without depending on a managing authority.</p>
<p>Ellison was also at the heart of the SPKI/SDSI project (1999) <sup><a href="#dfref-44" name="ref-44">4</a></sup> - <sup><a href="#dfref-55" name="ref-55">5</a></sup>. Its goal was to build a simpler public infrastructure for identity certificates that could replace the complicated X.509 system. Although centralized authorities were considered as an option, they were not the only option.</p>
<p>It was a beginning, but an even more revolutionary reconception of identity in the 21st century would be required to truly bring self-sovereignty to the forefront.</p>
<h1>Phase Two: Federated Identity <em>(administrative control by multiple, federated authorities)</em></h1>
<p>The next major advancement for digital identity occurred at the turn of the century when a variety of commercial organizations moved beyond hierarchy to debalkanize online identity in a new manner.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s Passport (1999) initiative was one of the first. It imagined <em>federated identity</em>, which allowed users to utilize the same identity on multiple sites. However, it put Microsoft at the center of the federation, which made it almost as centralized as traditional authorities.</p>
<p>In response Sun Microsoft organized the Liberty Alliance (2001). They resisted the idea of centralized authority, instead creating a &quot;true&quot; federation, but the result was instaed an oligarchy: the power of centralized authority was now divided among several powerful entities.</p>
<p>Federation improved on the problem of balkanization: users could wander from site to site under the system. However, each individual site remained an authority.</p>
<h1>Phase Three: User-Centric Identity <em>(individual</em> <strong><em>or</em></strong> <em>administrative control across multiple authorities without requiring a federation)</em></h1>
<p>The Augmented Social Network (2000) laid the groundwork for a new sort of digital identity in their proposal for the creation of a next-generation Internet. In an extensive white paper<sup><a href="#dfref-66" name="ref-66">6</a></sup>, they suggested building “persistent online identity” into the very architecture of the Internet. From the viewpoint of self-sovereign identity, their most important advance was “the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity”. The ASN group felt that Passport and the Liberty Alliance could not meet these goals because the “business-based initiatives” put too much emphasis on the privatization of information and the modeling of users as consumers.</p>
<p>These ASN ideas would become the foundation of much that followed.</p>
<p>The Identity Commons (2001-Present) began to consolidate the new work on digital identity with a focus on decentralization. Their most important contribution may have been the creation, in association with the Identity Gang, of the Internet Identity Workshop (2005-Present) working group. For the last ten years, the IIW has advanced the idea of decentralized identity in a series of semi-yearly meetings.</p>
<p>The IIW community focused on a new term that countered the server-centric model of centralized authorities: <em>user-centric identity</em>. The term suggests that users are placed in the middle of the identity process. Initial discussions of the topic focused on creating a better user experience<sup><a href="#dfref-77" name="ref-77">7</a></sup>, which underlined the need to put users front and center in the quest for online identity. However the definition of a user-centric identity soon expanded to include the desire for a user to have more control over his identity and for trust to be decentralized<sup><a href="#dfref-88" name="ref-88">8</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The work of the IIW has supported many new methods for creating digital identity, including OpenID (2005), OpenID 2.0 (2006), OpenID Connect (2014), OAuth (2010), and FIDO (2013). As implemented, user-centric methodologies tend to focus on two elements: user consent and interoperability. By adopting them, a user can decide to share an identity from one service to another and thus debalkanize his digital self.</p>
<p>The user-centric identity communities had even more ambitious visions; they intended to give users complete control of their digital identities. Unfortunately, powerful institutions co-opted their efforts and kept them from fully realizing their goals. Much as with the Liberty Alliance, final ownership of user-centric identities today remain with the entities that register them.</p>
<p>OpenID offers an example. A user can theoretically register his own OpenID, which he can then use autonomously. However, this takes some technical know-how, so the casual Internet user is more likely to use an OpenID from one public web site as a login for another. If the user selects a site that is long-lived and trustworthy, he can gain many of the advantages of a self-sovereign identity — but it could be taken away at any time by the registering entity!</p>
<p>Facebook Connect (2008) appeared a few years after OpenID, leveraging lessons learned, and thus was several times more successful largely due to a better user interface<sup><a href="#dfref-99" name="ref-99">9</a></sup>. Unfortunately, Facebook Connect veers even further from the original user-centric ideal of user control. To start with, there’s no choice of provider; it’s Facebook. Worse, Facebook has a history of arbitrarily closing accounts, as was seen in their recent real-name controversy<sup><a href="#dfref-1010" name="ref-1010">10</a></sup>. As a result, people who access other sites with their “user-centric” Facebook Connect identity may be even more vulnerable than OpenID users to losing that identity in multiple places at one time.</p>
<p>It’s central authorities all over again. Worse, it’s like state-controlled authentication of identity, except with a self-elected “rogue” state.</p>
<p>In other words: being user-centric isn’t enough.</p>
<h1>Phase Four: Self-Sovereign Identity <strong><em>(individual control across any number of authorities)</em></strong></h1>
<p>User-centric designs turned centralized identities into interoperable federated identities with centralized control, while also respecting some level of user consent about how to share an identity (and with whom). It was an important step toward true user control of identity, but just a step. To take the next step required user autonomy.</p>
<p>This is the heart of <em>self-sovereign identity</em>, a term that’s coming into increased use in the ‘10s. Rather than just advocating that users be at the center of the identity process, self-sovereign identity requires that users be the rulers of their own identity.</p>
<p>One of the first references to identity sovereignty occurred in February 2012, when developer Moxie Marlinspike wrote about “Sovereign Source Authority”<sup><a href="#dfref-1111" name="ref-1111">11</a></sup>. He said that individuals “have an established Right to an ‘identity’”, but that national registration destroys that sovereignty. Some ideas are in the air, so it’s no surprise that almost simultaneously, in March 2012, Patrick Deegan began work on Open Mustard Seed, an open-source framework that gives users control of their digital identity and their data in decentralized systems<sup><a href="#dfref-1212" name="ref-1212">12</a></sup>. It was one of several &quot;personal cloud&quot; initiatives that appeared around the same time.</p>
<p>Since then, the idea of self-sovereign identity has proliferated. Marlinspike has blogged how the term has evolved<sup><a href="#dfref-1313" name="ref-1313">13</a></sup>. As a developer, he shows one way to address self-sovereign identity: as a <em>mathematical policy</em>, where cryptography is used to protect a user’s autonomy and control. However, that’s not the only model. Respect Network instead addresses self-sovereign identity as a <em>legal policy</em>; they define contractual rules and principles that members of their network agree to follow<sup><a href="#dfref-1414" name="ref-1414">14</a></sup>. The Windhover Principles For Digital Identity, Trust and Data<sup><a href="#dfref-1515" name="ref-1515">15</a></sup> and Everynym’s Identity System Essentials<sup><a href="#dfref-1616" name="ref-1616">16</a></sup> offer some additional perspectives on the rapid advent of self-sovereign identity since 2012.</p>
<p>In the last year, self-sovereign identity has also entered the sphere of <em>international policy</em><sup><a href="#dfref-1717" name="ref-1717">17</a></sup>. This has largely been driven by the refugee crisis that has beset Europe, which has resulted in many people lacking a recognized identity due to their flight from the state that issued their credentials. However, it’s a long-standing international problem, as foreign workers have often been abused by the countries they work in due to the lack of state-issued credentials.</p>
<p>If self-sovereign identity was becoming relevant a few years ago, in light of current international crises its importance has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>The time to move toward self-sovereign identity is now.</p>
<h1>A Definition of Self-Sovereign Identity</h1>
<p>With all that said, what is self-sovereign identity exactly? The truth is that there’s no consensus. As much as anything, this article is intended to begin a dialogue on that topic. However, I wish to offer a starting position.</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity is the next step beyond user-centric identity and that means it begins at the same place: the user must be central to the administration of identity. That requires not just the interoperability of a user’s identity across multiple locations, with the user’s consent, but also true user control of that digital identity, creating user autonomy. To accomplish this, a self-sovereign identity must be transportable; it can’t be locked down to one site or locale.</p>
<p>A self-sovereign identity must also allow ordinary users to make claims, which could include personally identifying information or facts about personal capability or group membership<sup><a href="#dfref-1818" name="ref-1818">18</a></sup>. It can even contain information about the user that was asserted by other persons or groups.</p>
<p>In the creation of a self-sovereign identity, we must be careful to protect the individual. A self-sovereign identity must defend against financial and other losses, prevent human rights abuses by the powerful, and support the rights of the individual to be oneself and to freely associate<sup><a href="#dfref-1919" name="ref-1919">19</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, there’s a lot more to self-sovereign identity than just this brief summation. Any self-sovereign identity must also meet a series of guiding principles — and these principles actually provide a better, more comprehensive, definition of what self-sovereign identity is. A proposal for them follows:</p>
<h2>Ten Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity</h2>
<p>A number of different people have written about the principles of identity. Kim Cameron wrote one of the earliest “Laws of Identity”<sup><a href="#dfref-2020" name="ref-2020">20</a></sup>, while the aforementioned Respect Network policy<sup><a href="#dfref-2121" name="ref-2121">21</a></sup> and W3C Verifiable Claims Task Force FAQ<sup><a href="#dfref-2222" name="ref-2222">22</a></sup> offer additional perspectives on digital identity. This section draws on all of these ideas to create a group of principles specific to self-sovereign identity. As with the definition itself, consider these principles a departure point to provoke a discussion about what’s truly important.</p>
<p>These principles attempt to ensure the user control that’s at the heart of self-sovereign identity. However, they also recognize that identity can be a double-edged sword — usable for both beneficial and maleficent purposes. Thus, an identity system must balance transparency, fairness, and support of the commons with protection for the individual.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Existence.</strong> <em>Users must have an independent existence.</em> Any self-sovereign identity is ultimately based on the ineffable “I” that’s at the heart of identity. It can never exist wholly in digital form. This must be the kernel of self that is upheld and supported. A self-sovereign identity simply makes public and accessible some limited aspects of the “I” that already exists.</li>
<li><strong>Control.</strong> <em>Users must control their identities.</em> Subject to well-understood and secure algorithms that ensure the continued validity of an identity and its claims, the user is the ultimate authority on their identity. They should always be able to refer to it, update it, or even hide it. They must be able to choose celebrity or privacy as they prefer. This doesn’t mean that a user controls all of the claims on their identity: other users may make claims about a user, but they should not be central to the identity itself.</li>
<li><strong>Access.</strong> <em>Users must have access to their own data.</em> A user must always be able to easily retrieve all the claims and other data within his identity. There must be no hidden data and no gatekeepers. This does not mean that a user can necessarily modify all the claims associated with his identity, but it does mean they should be aware of them. It also does not mean that users have equal access to others’ data, only to their own.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong>. <em>Systems and algorithms must be transparent.</em> The systems used to administer and operate a network of identities must be open, both in how they function and in how they are managed and updated. The algorithms should be free, open-source, well-known, and as independent as possible of any particular architecture; anyone should be able to examine how they work.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence.</strong> <em>Identities must be long-lived.</em> Preferably, identities should last forever, or at least for as long as the user wishes. Though private keys might need to be rotated and data might need to be changed, the identity remains. In the fast-moving world of the Internet, this goal may not be entirely reasonable, so at the least identities should last until they’ve been outdated by newer identity systems. This must not contradict a “right to be forgotten”; a user should be able to dispose of an identity if he wishes and claims should be modified or removed as appropriate over time. To do this requires a firm separation between an identity and its claims:&#0160;they can&#39;t be tied forever.</li>
<li><strong>Portability.</strong> <em>Information and services about identity must be transportable.</em> Identities must not be held by a singular third-party entity, even if it&#39;s a trusted entity that is expected to work in the best interest of the user. The problem is that entities can disappear — and on the Internet, most eventually do. Regimes may change, users may move to different jurisdictions. Transportable identities ensure that the user remains in control of his identity no matter what, and can also improve an identity’s persistence over time.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability.</strong> <em>Identities should be as widely usable as possible.</em> Identities are of little value if they only work in limited niches. The goal of a 21st-century digital identity system is to make identity information widely available, crossing international boundaries to create global identities, without losing user control. Thanks to persistence and autonomy these widely available identities can then become continually available.</li>
<li><strong>Consent.</strong> <em>Users must agree to the use of their identity.</em> Any identity system is built around sharing that identity and its claims, and an interoperable system increases the amount of sharing that occurs. However, sharing of data must only occur with the consent of the user. Though other users such as an employer, a credit bureau, or a friend might present claims, the user must still offer consent for them to become valid. Note that this consent might not be interactive, but it must still be deliberate and well-understood.</li>
<li><strong>Minimalization.</strong> <em>Disclosure of claims must be minimized.</em> When data is disclosed, that disclosure should involve the minimum amount of data necessary to accomplish the task at hand. For example, if only a minimum age is called for, then the exact age should not be disclosed, and if only an age is requested, then the more precise date of birth should not be disclosed. This principle can be supported with selective disclosure, range proofs, and other zero-knowledge techniques, but non-correlatibility is still a very hard (perhaps impossible) task; the best we can do is to use minimalization to support privacy as best as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Protection.</strong> <em>The rights of users must be protected.</em> When there is a conflict between the needs of the identity network and the rights of individual users, then the network should err on the side of preserving the freedoms and rights of the individuals over the needs of the network. To ensure this, identity authentication must occur through independent algorithms that are censorship-resistant and force-resilient and that are run in a decentralized manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>I seek your assistance in taking these principles to the next level. I will be at the IIW conference this week, at other conferences this month, and in particular I will be meeting with other identity technologists on May 21st and 22nd in NYC after the ID 2020 Summit on Digital Identity. These principles will be placed into <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/ThePathToSelf-SovereignIdentity.md">Github</a> and we hope to collaborate with all those interested in refining them through the workshop, or through Github <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherA/self-sovereign-identity/pulls">pull requests</a> from the broader community. Come join us!</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The idea of digital identity has been evolving for a few decades now, from centralized identities to federated identities to user-centric identities to self-sovereign identities. However, even today exactly what a self-sovereign identity is, and what rules it should recognize, aren’t well-known.</p>
<p>This article seeks to begin a dialogue on that topic, by offering up a definition and a set of principles as a starting point for this new form of user-controlled and persistent identity of the 21st century.</p>
<h2>Glossary</h2>
<p>The following terms are relevant to this article. These are just a subset of the terms generally used to discuss digital identity, and have been minimized to avoid unnecessary complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Authority.</strong> A trusted entity that is able to verify and authenticate identities. Clasically, this was a centralized (or later, federated) entity. Now, this can also be an open and transparent algorithm run in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p><strong>Claim.</strong> A statement about an identity. This could be: a fact, such as a person&#39;s age; an opinion, such as a rating of their trustworthiness; or something in between, such as an assessment of a skill.</p>
<p><strong>Credential.</strong> In the identity community this term overlaps with claims. Here it is used instead for the dictionary definition: &quot;entitlement to privileges, or the like, usually in written form&quot;<sup><a href="#dfref-2323" name="ref-2323">23</a></sup>. In other words, credentials refer to the state-issued plastic and paper IDs that grant people access in the modern world. A credential generally incorporates one or more identifiers and numerous claims about a single entity, all authenticated with some sort of digital signature.</p>
<p><strong>Identifier.</strong> A name or other label that uniquely identifies an identity. For simplicity&#39;s sake, this term has been avoided in this article (except in this glossary), but it&#39;s generally important to an understanding of digital identity.</p>
<p><strong>Identity.</strong> A representation of an entity. It can include claims and identifiers. In this article, the focus is on <em>digital</em> identity.</p>

In our MBA program, we don&#39;t just teach about competitive strategy&#0160;(using classic&#39;s like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-Competition-Michael-E-Porter/dp/0875847951">Porter&#39;s book</a>), but we also teach about the nature of&#0160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopetition" title="Wikipedia link to Coopetition">coopetition</a>. These practices&#0160;are more&#0160;likely to lead to sustainable businesses (not only sustainable=green, but sustainable=enduring).</p>
<p>I have been a participant during several periods of technology history where coopetition has been practiced, most recently during the early days of the Twitter ecosystem. I can distinctly remember two companies&#0160;offering competitive Twitter clients sharing best practices at the <a href="http://www.iosdevcamp.org">iOSDevCamp</a> hackathon I hosted. Unfortunately these practices ended when Twitter pulled the rug out from independent developers by controlling the API keys under the guise of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131017201719/https://dev.twitter.com/blog/delivering-consistent-twitter-experience">Delivering a Consistent Twitter Experience</a><em>&#0160;(post now only visible on Internet Archive)</em>. There are some that argue that Twitter may have ultimately <a href="http://www.novaspivack.com/technology/where-twitter-went-wrong-and-how-to-right-it">killed its ecosystem</a> in pursuit of short-term profits over a long-term community of innovators. We have seen this take over elsewhere as described in&#0160;<a href="https://pando.com/2012/11/03/how-ecosystems-became-the-new-walled-gardens/">How Ecosystems Became the New Walled Gardens</a>.</p>
<p>So what makes a great participatory ecosystem? My recent work in trying to understand Elinor Ostrom&#39;s <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/11/a-revised-ostroms-design-principles-for-collective-governance-of-the-commons-.html">design principles for the collective governance of the commons</a>&#0160;and some other thoughts have led me to this definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Participatory Ecosystem</h3>
<p>A participatory ecosystem is a business ecosystem with relatively low barriers to economic participation, artistic and professional expression, and civic engagement by all stakeholders, including producers and consumers.</p>
<p>It has strong support for creating, sharing and increasing the production of goods and services of value to the ecosystem. A participatory ecosystem will have system processes where established stakeholders are incentivized to share knowledge, access to markets, and capital to new stakeholders in the ecosystem, and to turn consumers into producers.</p>
<p>Stakeholders with leadership positions in a participatory ecosystem may change over time, but the function of an ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions, grow the market, to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>A participatory system is resilient, and has system processes, such as decentralization, to prevent bad actors. Every stakeholder in a participatory ecosystem believes that their goods and services matter, and feel some degree of social connection and community with one another (at least they care what other people think about what they produce.) Not every stakeholder must produce, but all must believe that they are free to produce when ready and what they contribute will be appropriately valued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not completely an original idea&#0160;— it is of&#0160;a mashup of Henry Jenkins’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_culture">“participatory culture”</a>&#0160;definition&#0160;with&#0160;James Moore’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_ecosystem">“business ecosystem”</a>&#0160;ideas. I&#39;ve added a few&#0160;things I&#39;ve observed about&#0160;working participatory ecosystems, and have also&#0160;run this definition&#0160;by a number of my colleagues in a variety of industries for small tweaks.</p>
<p>Most recently I&#39;ve been using it in talks about the blockchain ecosystem. I have <a href="https://blockstream.com/2016/04/05/blockstream-christopher-allen-linux-foundation-w3c-ietf/">recently joined</a> <a href="http://www.blockstream.com">Blockstream</a>&#0160;where I am leading a number of&#0160;strategic initiatives, including the company’s participation in cross-industry collaborations, as well as future technical efforts with international standards organizations such as W3C, IETF, and Oasis. In these efforts I have been sharing this definition more broadly, and it seems to be resonating with the community, in particular as the blockchain community cares deeply about decentralization.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve posted this definition to <a href="http://www.participatoryecosystem.com/">Github</a>&#0160;hoping that others can fork it and submit pull requests to make it better — just like how&#0160;open source world works!</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Resource Sharing" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c76aaed3970b-250wi" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Resource Sharing" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The traditional economic definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons" target="_self"><em>“the commons”</em></a> are those resources that are held in common and not privately owned. This is closely related to economic concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good" target="_self">public goods</a>, which are goods that are both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability" target="_self">non-excludable</a> (in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)" target="_self">non-rivalrous</a> (where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others).</p>
<p>My own personal definition for the commons is broader — any regenerative, self-organizing complex system that can be drawn upon for <a href="http://www.artbrock.com/presentations/new-economy-new-wealth" target="_self">deep wealth</a>. These can include traditional commons, such as lumber, fish, etc., but can also include other regenerative systems such as communities, markets, intellectual property, etc.</p>
<p>In 2009, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom" target="_self">Elinor Ostrom</a> received the Nobel Prize in Economics for her “analysis of economic governance, especially the commons”. In that, she listed 8 principles for effectively managing against the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>However, I&#39;ve found her original words — as well as many adaptions I&#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there also has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.</p>
<p>I also wanted to generalize her principles for broader use given my broader definition of the commons, and apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors. I went to the original version, more contemporary research, as well as a number of modern adaptions to define a new set of design principles.</p>
<p>My&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2015/03/10-design-principles-for-governing-the-commons.html" target="_self">first draft</a>&#0160;divided up her 8 principles into 10. I then ran this&#0160;list by a number of experts in this field, and here is my second draft based on their feedback. This draft in fact breaks up her principles into 12 different ones, but I have retained her old numbering system as there are large number of works that refer to the original 8. In addition, there appears to be some differences in thoughts on number 8, so I&#39;ve included two variations.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Ostrom’s Design Principles for Collective Governance of the Commons</h2>
<p dir="ltr">or</p>
<h3 dir="ltr"><em>How to Avoid the Tragedy of the Commons within Self-Organizing Systems</em></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1A. DEFINE AUTHORIZED USE:</strong> The community of those who have the right to use the common resource is clearly defined.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>1B. DEFINE COMMONS BOUNDARIES:</strong> The boundaries of the commons are clearly defined so as to separate the usage rules from the larger environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2A. MAKE COSTS PROPORTIONAL:</strong> Costs for using and maintaining the commons are proportional to the benefits that those users receive from the commons.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>2B. PAY ALL COSTS:</strong> People that use the commons keep costs inside the local system as much as possible. They do not externalize costs either to neighbors or future generations.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3A. DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:</strong> Everyone who benefits from or is affected by the use of the commons makes choices about it. This includes decision-making on resource allocation and on rules and responsibilities for use of the commons. Members of the community operate with respect and mutual regard for each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>3B. ADAPT LOCALLY:</strong> Members of the community adapt the rules and culture for the commons to local needs, resource qualities and environmental conditions.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4A. SHARE KNOWLEDGE:</strong> All members are actively engaged in observing and sharing knowledge about the conditions of the system.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>4B. MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:</strong> Monitors who are members of (or supported by and accountable to) the community view and report on the use and maintenance of the commons by community members and others.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>5. HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Violators of the rules or culture of the commons face graduated sanctions, proportional to the seriousness of the transgression. These are applied by members of the community or by others who are accountable to community for applying such consequences.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>6. PROMPTLY RESOLVE CONFLICTS:</strong> The community offers inexpensive, fast and easy access to mediation for effective conflict resolution.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>7. GOVERN LOCALLY:</strong> Community self-determination is recognized and supported by higher-level authorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>8. CONNECT TO RELATED SYSTEMS:</strong> Any side effects or other repercussions by one community to another in managing their commons, should be addressed in the context of larger, nested communities that have a legitimate role in those consequences. These externalities should be resolved by the community at the most immediate or local level (aka subsidiarity) that can operate from effective human relationships, rather than by a faceless authority.</p>
<p><strong>ALT 8. COORDINATE WITH RELATED SYSTEMS</strong>: For groups that are part of larger social systems, there must be appropriate coordination among relevant groups. Every sphere of activity has an optimal scale. Large scale governance requires finding the optimal scale for each sphere of activity and appropriately coordinating the activities, a concept called polycentric governance. A related concept is subsidiarity, which assigns governance tasks by default to the lowest jurisdiction, unless this is explicitly determined to be ineffective.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Consensus-flowchart" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1551c0e970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Consensus-flowchart" /></a>I have made understanding of consent and consensus, in both their human and technological forms, a major part of my career. I have explored them through my work in cryptographic technologies, but also in human terms at the&#0160;<a href="http://groupworksdeck.org/" target="_self" title="Group Pattern Language Project">Group Pattern Language Project</a>, by co-authoring with Shannon Appecline forthcoming book on the design of collaborative games, and another book in progress on the patterns of cooperative play. My business management style is also more collaborative and inclusive.</p>
<p>This topic is so important to me that I named the company I founded in 1988 (that eventually led the effort to establish TLS 1.0 as an internet standard) was named &quot;Consensus Development&quot; (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19980709005818/http://www.consensus.com/" target="_self">archive.org</a>).</p>
<p>Thus&#0160;I&#39;ve been fascinated this week to watch a major online community try to define for itself what “consent” and “consensus” in their community will mean.&#0160;This community in question is the Bitcoin cryptocurrency community, which is faced with a minority of the community attempting to “hard fork”. This weekend they <a href="https://scalingbitcoin.org/montreal2015/" target="_self">meet in Montreal </a>to attempt to discover another way to return to some form of unanimity and broad consent of their stakeholders.</p>
<p>This is of the hardest problems in human interactions. Consent comes from the Latin, meaning “feel together”, which this community now believes they lack. But&#0160;it is particularly poignant that this particular community is facing these questions. Bitcoin is technologically based on a formal protocol that uses a mathematical and cryptographic method for consensus called the “blockchain”. Every 10 minutes, thousands of nodes and hundreds of miners arrive at a consensus on all the bitcoin transactions during that time. Bitcoin, and the larger Blockchain community are the worlds experts on cryptographic forms of consensus. But the human consensus problem is still hard for them too.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.5em;">A Spectrum of Consent</span></p>
<p>In my recent efforts into understanding this topic, and some recent dives into my &#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html" target="_self" title="Systems for Collective Choice (start of series)">Systems For Collective Choice</a>,&#0160;the topic of the <em>A Spectrum Of Consent</em>&#0160;has repeatedly come up. There appear to be a range of levels of consent required for various deliberative processes and voting systems.</p>
<p>I have had these incomplete notes on the Spectrum of Consent around for a couple of years, which I&#39;ve only shared privately. However, given my discussions this week at the&#0160;<a href="http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/" target="_self">Consensus 2015</a>&#0160;conference and elsewhere, it was time to share. I welcome comments and suggestions!</p>
<p>Basically, many groups view consensus processes as a requirement, however, many others see consensus processes as unworkable and a serious problem to be avoided. These efforts to define <em>A Spectrum Of Consent</em> are somewhat to help me understand this dichotomy. I personally believe that certain deliberative processes and voting systems are good for some things, some for others. But I find I&#39;m rare in that opinion — most people lean strongly in way one or the other.</p>
<p>There is clearly some conflation and orthogonality in my list below of types of representation (who decides), deliberation (how you approach a decision), and choice selection method (voting system), but I think this is a good start at defining a spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Consensus (or Absolute Agreement)</strong> — A voting system where all parties are required support and agree to a decision, without anyone voting to neither agree or disagree (aka abstaining).</p>
<p><strong>Unanimous Consent (or Unanimity)</strong> — A voting system where all parties support and agree to a decision, however, some parties may abstain by raising no objections.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Decision Making</strong> — A deliberative process of reaching unanimous consent (everyone agrees or abstains) with a number of procedural rules or cultural norms that limit blocking. Most forms of Consensus Decision Making all members have equal voice in the deliberation and equal vote. Most ask a closing question question such as &quot;Are there any remaining unresolved concerns?&quot; or &quot;Are there any paramount objections?&quot;. Some believe that in Consensus Decision Making that there is never a “vote”. (Another <a href="http://www.community4me.com/consensus.html" target="_self">definition of consensus</a>) (PDF on the <a href="http://seedsforchange.org.uk/consensus.pdf" target="_self" title="Consensus PDF">Consensus Process</a>) and (<a href="https://rhizomenetwork.wordpress.com/2011/05/30/when-not-to-use-consensus/" target="_self" title="When to not use Consensus">when to not use consensus</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sense of Meeting</strong> — A deliberative deliberative process practice as originally created by the Quakers. It is related to consensus which seeks “unity in the discernment of a decision” It is not necessary for every member to fully agree with a decision, but rather for members “to discern that as a body they are called in a particular direction.”</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Minus One</strong> — A voting system where a party may block only if they can find at least one other uninvolved party to agree to join together to block. Otherwise the decision passes.</p>
<p><strong>Consensus Seeking</strong> — A deliberation process that attempt to reach unanimous consent, but can fall back to a majority vote when required. Essentially Consensus Decision Making in deliberative process — listening to those with objections, but the ability to go to a vote stops the &quot;tyranny of the minority&quot; that sometimes happens with consensus.</p>
<p><strong>Mediated Consensus</strong>&#0160;— Related to Consensus Seeking. An immediate decision can be made by consensus, but if that fails the blockers and proponents have to meet separately with or without a mediator, and if they still don&#39;t agree then its brought back to the next meeting for a vote.&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Consensus&#0160;(still seeking right name of this one)</strong> — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. Consensus is required within each group but not of the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Consequential Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)</strong> — Only those affected by the outcome of the decision can participate and vote in the decision, which requires consensus of all those affected.</p>
<p><strong>Representative Consensus (still seeking right name of this one)</strong> — Each party who participates in the deliberation votes represents the interests of others by some rules. Consensus is required only among the representatives.</p>
<p><strong>Appreciative Inquiry Based Deliberation (another one needing naming)</strong> — A deliberative process that focuses on moving forward on moving forward on things that there is agreement on that are &quot;the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Blocking or Vetoing Representation</strong>— Voting systems where one or more members may have the right to block the deliberative process before a vote, or veto after a vote.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Super Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be larger than a simple majority based on the entire membership rather than only on those present and voting, typically 2/3rds.</p>
<p><strong>Super Majority or Qualified Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be greater than a simple majority of those present and voting, typically 2/3rds of those voting.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass much be 50% + 1 vote, based on the entire membership rather than on those present and voting.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Majority</strong> — A voting system where support for a proposal to pass must be 50% + 1 vote of those present and voting.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of Order or&#0160;Parliamentary&#0160;Procedure</strong>&#0160;— A deliberative process such as&#0160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order" target="_self">Robert&#39;s Rules of Order</a>&#0160;or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_procedure" target="_self">other rules</a>&#0160;used by legislative bodies such as a senate or parliaments,&#0160;but &#0160;often used by corporations for decision making such as a board of directors meeting.&#0160;&#0160;At their heart is the rule of the majority with respect for the minority. Its object is to allow deliberation&#0160;upon questions of interest to the group and to arrive at the sense or the will of the organization as a whole upon these questions.</p>
<p><strong>Plurality or Relative Majority</strong> — A voting system where when there are multiple options, the largest number of votes wins.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Fork</strong> — Unique to open source communities, consensus can be reached by having the stakeholders lacking consensus to split off to form their own consensus, and since the assets are largely intellectual the can compete equally for the attention of the community and markets they serve.</p>
<p><strong>Citizen Assembly (sometimes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition" target="_self" title="sortition">sortition</a>, public sector representation, jury or allotment)</strong> — A deliberative process where a representative random sample of eligible voters is selected to make binding decisions for the group. The voting system used may be consensus or some form of majority. Ancient Athenian democracy actually form of this of this in the Boule and Jury.</p>
<p><strong>Distributed Authority</strong> — There are some rules for how decision making is distributed into smaller, inter-related groups, each who have authority over a domain. How each group makes decisions is decided by that group.</p>
<p><strong>Executive Authority</strong> — Rules for how a party is elected to represent a group, who then has authority to make decisions for that group, typically for a limited period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Dictatorship</strong> — Executive authority exercised to ensure a monopoly of authority by its elected representative.</p>

<p>I&#39;m heading out today to New York City to speak at <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/events/consensus-2015/">Consensus 2015</a>, where I am speaking on the panel <em>‘Bitcoin and its Antecedents: A Look at the History and Evolution of Digital Cash’</em>:</p>
<blockquote>Bitcoin is far from the first attempt at creating a form of digital money with the potential to upend existing systems. Our panelists will look at bitcoin&#39;s predecessors and close cousins. Nathaniel Popper wrote the book Digital Gold, which delves into bitcoin&#39;s genesis; Christopher Allen is an internet security expert who has been involved in digital cash systems including Digicash for decades, while Garrick Hileman is CoinDesk&#39;s lead analyst and an economic historian at the LSE, specializing in alternative and private monies.</blockquote>
<p>This invite probably came about from an extended interview that Tim Swanson, author of the blockchain book and blog <a href="http://www.ofnumbers.com">The Great Wall of Numbers</a>,&#0160;shared with his readers. Tim wrote me saying <em>“There is some dispute, apparently, of the history and precursors of distributed computing / consensus before Bitcoin<em>”</em></em>, and&#0160;and asked me if I would share my <em>“own view of what a blockchain is defined as, what Nakamoto consensus is relative to other &#39;solutions&#39; to Byzantine faults, triple entry accounting, etc.”</em> He published my answers in his post <a href="http://www.ofnumbers.com/2015/07/09/a-blockchain-with-emphasis-on-the-a/">A blockchain with emphasis on the ‘a’</a>.&#0160;For posterity, I thought I&#39;d also share my part of the interview here:</p>
<p>I certainly was an early digital currency banner waiver — I did some consulting work with Xanadu, and later for the very early Digicash. At various points in the growth of SSL both First Virtual and PGP tried to acquire my company. When I saw Nick’s “<a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548/469">First Monday</a>” article the day it came out, as it immediately clicked a number of different puzzle pieces that I’d not quite put together into one place. I immediately started using the term smart contracts and was telling my investors, and later Certicom, that this is what we really should be doing (maybe because I was getting tired of battles in SSL/TLS standards when that wasn’t what Consensus Development had been really founded to solve).</p>
<p>However, in the end, I don’t think any thing I did actually went anywhere, either technically or as a business, other than maybe getting some other technologists interested. So in the end I’m more of a witness to the birth of these technologies than a creator.</p>
<p>History in this area is distorted by software patents—there are a number of innovative approaches that would be scrapped because of awareness of litigious patent holders. I distinctly remember when I first heard about some innovative hash chain ideas that a number of us wanted to use hash trees with it, but we couldn’t figure out how to avoid the 1979 Merkle Hash Tree patent whose base patent wouldn’t expire until ’96, as well as some other subsidiary hash tree and time stamp patents that wouldn’t expire until early 2000s.</p>
<p>As I recall, at the time were we all trying to inspired solve the micropayment problem. Digicash had used cryptography for larger-sized cash transactions, whereas First Virtual, Cybercash and others were focused on securing the ledger side and needed larger transaction fees and thus larger amounts of money to function. To scale down we were all looking at hash chain ideas from Lamport’s S/KEY from the late 80’s and distributed transactional ledgers from X/Open’s DTP from the early 90s as inspirations. DEC introduced Millicent during this period, and I distinctly remember people saying “this will not work, it requires consumers to hold keys in a electronic wallet”. On the cryptographic hash side of this problem Adam Back did Hashcash, Rivest and his crew introduced PayWord and Micromint. On the transaction side CMU introduced <a href="http://www.informedia.cs.cmu.edu/documents/netbill.pdf">NetBill</a>.</p>
<p>Nick Szabo wrote using hashes for post-unforgeable transaction logs in his original <a href="http://szabo.best.vwh.net/formalize.html">smart contract paper</a> in ’97, in which he referred to <a href="Surety’s work">Surety’s work</a> (and they held the Merkle hash tree and other time signature patents), but in that original paper he did not look at Proof-of-Work at all. It was another year before he, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney started talking about using proof-of-work as a possible foundational element for smart contracts. I remember some discussions over beer in Palo Alto circa ’99 with Nick after I became CTO of Certicom about creating dedicated proof-of-work secure hardware that would create tokens that could be used as an underlying basis for his smart contract ideas. This was interesting to Certicom as we had very good connections into cryptographic hardware industry, and I recommended that we should hire him. Nick eventually joined Certicom, but by that point they had cancelled my advanced cryptography group to raise profits in order to go public in the US (causing me to resign), and then later ceased all work in that area when the markets fell in 2001.</p>
<p>I truly believe that would could have had cryptographic smart contracts by ’04 if Certicom had not focused on short-profits (see Solution #3 at bottom of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html">this post</a> for my thoughts back in 2004 after a 3-year non-compete and NDA)…</p>
<blockquote>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on Smart Contracts. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible.</blockquote>
<p>When I first heard about Bitcoin, I saw it as having clearly two different parts. First was a mix of old ideas about unforgeable transaction logs using hash trees combined into blocks connected by hash chains. This clearly is the “blockchain”. But in order for this blockchain to function, it needed timestamping, for which fortunately all the patents had expired. The second essential part of Bitcoin was through a proof-of-work system to timestamp the blocks, which clearly was based on Back’s HashCash rather than the way transactions were timestamped in Szabo’s BitGold implementation.</p>
<p>I have to admit, when I first saw it I didn’t really see much in Bitcoin that was innovative — but did appreciate how it combined a number of older ideas into one place. I did not predict its success, but thought it was an interesting experiment and that might lead to a more elegant solution. (BTW, IMHO Bitcoin became successful more because of how it leveraged cypherpunk memes and their incentives to participate in order to bootstrap the ecosystem rather than because of any particularly elegant or orginal cryptographic ideas).</p>
<p>In my head, Bitcoin consists of blocks of cryptographic transactional ledgers chained together, plus one particular approach to time-stamping this block chain that uses proof-of-work method of consensus. I’ve always thought of blockchain and mining as separate innovations.</p>
<p>To support this separation for your article, I have one more <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2011/05/bitcoin-what-took-ye-so-long.html">quote</a> to offer you from Nick Szabo:</p>
<blockquote>Instead of my automated market to account for the fact that the difficulty of puzzles can often radically change based on hardware improvements and cryptographic breakthroughs (i.e. discovering algorithms that can solve proofs-of-work faster), and the unpredictability of demand, Nakamoto designed a Byzantine-agreed algorithm adjusting the difficulty of puzzles. I can’t decide whether this aspect of Bitcoin is more feature or more bug, but it does make it simpler.</blockquote>
<p>As to your question of when the community first started using the word consensus, I am not sure. The cryptographic company I founded in 1988 that eventually created the reference implementation of SSL 3.0 and offered the first TLS 1.0 toolkits was named “Consensus Development” so my memory is distorted. To me, the essential problem has always been how to solve consensus. I may have first read it about it in “The Ecology of Computation” published in 1988 which predicted many distributed computational approaches that are only becoming possible today, which mentions among other things such concepts as Distributed Scheduling Protocols, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance, Computational Auctions, etc. But I also heard it from various science fiction books of the period, so that is why I named my company after it.</p>

<p>(This article has been cross-posted in <a href="https://medium.com/@christophera/the-four-kinds-of-privacy-bf4b0bf222ac" target="_self" title="Medium">Medium</a>)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd15c970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ssh by Katie Tegtmeyer CC-BY (crop2)" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd15c970b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ssh by Katie Tegtmeyer CC-BY" /></a></span></p>
<p><span>Privacy is hitting the headlines more than ever. As computer users are asked to change their passwords again and again in the wake of exploits like </span><a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a><span> and </span><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Shellshock</a><span>, they&#39;re becoming aware of the vulnerability of their online data — a susceptibility that was recently verified by scores of celebrities who had their most intimate photographs stolen.</span></p>
<p><em>Any</em> of us could have our privacy violated at any time… but what does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>I think that&#39;s a tricky question, and I say that with decades of experience in the privacy and security fields. In the early &#39;90s I helped with anti-Clipper Chip activism and supported efforts to allow free export of RSAREF cryptography tools such as PGP. I&#39;m also the co-author of the internet SSL standard, now the most broadly deployed security standard in the world (the &quot;s&quot; in &quot;https&quot;). I&#39;ve been involved with several security companies — as an entrepreneur, a former CTO of <a href="http://www.certicom.com/">Certicom</a>, and most recently as the VP of Developer Relations at <a href="http://www.blackphone.ch/">Blackphone</a>.</p>
<p>In all that time, I&#39;ve been very careful about my use of the word &quot;privacy&quot;. For example, I founded a company that designed and sold the first commercial SSL toolkits. The technology clearly included privacy features, but our marketing said that SSL offered &quot;message integrity&quot;, &quot;confidentiality&quot; and &quot;authentication&quot;. We did not use the word &quot;privacy&quot;.</p>
<p>This purposeful omission resulted from my feeling that the concept was too overloaded; if I promised privacy I might not be promising the same thing to everyone because people view the term in different ways.</p>
<p>What privacy means varies between Europe and the US, between libertarians and public figures, between the developed world and developing countries, between women and men. I think it&#39;s possible to differentiate no less than four different kinds of privacy, each of which is important to different people — and I&#39;m going to be defining them over the course of this article.</p>
<h2 id="toc_1">Prelude: Defining Public</h2>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d106582b970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Cayucos Parade (Cropped, original by Mike Baird licensed CC-BY)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d106582b970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d106582b970c-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Cayucos Parade (Cropped, original by Mike Baird licensed CC-BY)" /></a>However, before you can define privacy, you first have to define its opposite number: what&#39;s public. <a href="http://meriam-webster.com/">Meriam-Webster.com</a>&#39;s first definition of &quot;public&quot; includes two different descriptions that are somewhat contradictory. The first is <em>&quot;exposed to general view: open&quot;</em> and the second is <em>&quot;well-known; prominent&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>These definitions are at odds with each other because it&#39;s easy for something to be exposed to view <em>without</em> it being prominent. In fact, that defines a lot of our everyday life. If you have a conversation with a friend in a restaurant or if you do something in your living room with the curtains open or if you write a message for friends on Facebook, you presume that what you&#39;re doing will not be well-known, but it certainly <em>could</em> be open to general view.</p>
<p>So, is it public or is it private?</p>
<p>It turns out that this is a very old question. When talking about recent celebrity photo thefts, <a href="http://www.psmag.com/navigation/politics-and-law/celebrity-photo-hacking-scandal-shows-old-privacy-laws-need-serious-update-90087/">Kyle Chayka</a> highlighted the early 20th-century case of Gabrielle Darley Melvin, an ex-prostitute who had been acquitted of murderer. After settling quietly into marriage, Melvin found herself the subject of an unauthorized movie that ripped apart the fabric of her new life. Melvin sued the makers of the film but lost. She was told in the 1931 decision <a href="https://casetext.com/case/melvin-v-reid">Melvin v. Reid</a>: &quot;<em>When the incidents of a life are so public as to be spread upon a public record they come within the knowledge and into the possession of the public and cease to be private.&quot;</em> So the Supreme Court of Los Angeles had one answer for what was public and what was private.</p>
<p>Melvin&#39;s case was one where public events had clearly entered the public consciousness. However today, more and more of what people once thought of as private is also escaping into the public sphere — and we&#39;re often surprised by it. That&#39;s because we think that private means secret, and it doesn&#39;t; it just means something that isn&#39;t public. Yet. <a href="https://medium.com/message/what-is-public-f33b16d780f9">Anil Dash</a> recently discussed this on <em>Medium</em> and he highlighted a few reasons that privacy is rapidly sliding down this slippery slope of publication.</p>
<p>First, companies have financial incentives for making things &quot;well-known&quot; or &quot;prominent&quot;. The 24-hour news cycle is forcing media to report <em>everything</em>, so they&#39;re mobbing celebrities and publishing conversations from Facebook or Twitter that people consider private. Meanwhile, an increasing number of tech companies are mining deep ores of data and selling them to the highest bidder; the more information that they can find, the more they can sell.</p>
<p>Second, technology is making it ridiculously easy to take those situations that are considered &quot;private&quot; despite being <em>&quot;exposed to general view&quot;</em> and making them public. It&#39;s easier than ever to record a conversation, or steal data, or photograph or film through a window, or overhear a discussion. Some of these methods are legal, some aren&#39;t, but they&#39;re all happening — and they seem to be becoming more frequent.</p>
<p>The problem is big enough that governments are passing laws on the topic. In May 2014, the European Court of Justice decreed that people had a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/explainer-right-to-be-forgotten-the-newest-cultural-shibboleth">&quot;Right to Be Forgotten&quot;</a>: they should be able to remove information about themselves from the public sphere if it&#39;s no longer relevant, making it private once more. Whether this was a good decision remains to be seen, as it&#39;s already resulted in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/02/wikipedia-page-google-link-hidden-right-to-be-forgotten">removal of information</a> that clearly <em>is</em> relevant to the public sphere. In addition, it&#39;s very much at odds with the laws and rights of the United States, especially the free speech clause of the <a href="http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment1.html">First Amendment</a>. As Jeffrey Toobin said in a recent <em>New Yorker</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/solace-oblivion">article</a>: <em>&quot;In Europe, the right to privacy trumps freedom of speech; the reverse is true in the United States.&quot;</em></p>
<p>All of this means that the line between public and private remains as fuzzy as ever.</p>
<p>We have a deep need for the public world: both to be a part of it and to share ourselves with it. However, we also have a deep need for privacy: to keep our information, our households, our activities, and our intimate connections free from general view. In the modern world, drawing the line between these two poles is something that every single person has to consider and manage.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that each individual define their own privacy needs — so that they can fight for the kinds of privacy that are important to them.</p>
<h2 id="toc_2">The First Kind: Defensive Privacy</h2>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd194970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Hacker (Cropped, original by Christophe Verdier licensed CC-BY-NC) " class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd194970b img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd194970b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Hacker (Cropped, original by Christophe Verdier licensed CC-BY-NC) " /></a>The first type of privacy is <strong><em>defensive privacy</em></strong>, which protects against transient financial loss resulting from information collection or theft. This is the territory of phishers, conmen, blackmailers, identity thieves, and organized crime. It could also be the purview of governments that seize assets from people or businesses.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of defensive privacy is that any loss is ultimately transitory. A phisher might temporarily access a victim&#39;s bank accounts, or an identity thief might cause problems by taking out new credit in the victim&#39;s name, or a government might confiscate a victim&#39;s assets. However, once a victim&#39;s finances have been lost, and they&#39;ve spent some time clearing the problem up, they can then get back on their feet. The losses also might be recoverable — or if not, at least insurable.</p>
<p>This type of privacy is nonetheless important because assaults against it are very common and the losses can still be very damaging. The latest Bureau of Justice <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/press/vit12pr.cfm">report</a> says that 16.6 million Americans were affected in 2012 by identity theft alone, resulting in $24.7 billion dollars being stolen, or about $1,500 per victim. Though most victims were able to clear up the problems in less than a day, 10% had to spend more than a month.</p>
<p>Though defensive privacy is usually violated by illegal acts, US courts haven&#39;t always recognized the need for privacy of financial records. For example, in the 1976 case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15052729295643479698&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">United States vs. Miller</a> — which was about defrauding the government of whiskey tax — the Supreme Court declared that an individual&#39;s financial records at a bank were not &quot;private papers&quot; but instead the <em>&quot;business records of the banks&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>It used to be that the biggest danger to defensive privacy was someone digging through a victim&#39;s trash for old bank and credit card statements. However, today the interconnectiveness of the world is making it easier than ever to trick someone out of their financial information. Phishing emails are growing increasingly sophisticated, while social scammers are taking over Facebook and email accounts to pretend to be friends in distress in a <a href="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/stranded-scam.shtml">foreign country</a>. The newest fad seems to be a resurrection of an old con: cold calling victims and pretending to be <a href="http://www.snopes.com/fraud/telephone/microsoft.asp">Microsoft support</a> in the hope of taking over a victim&#39;s computer.</p>
<p>In other words, defensive privacy is more important than ever — which is unfortunately a trend that crosses all of the kinds of privacy in recent years.</p>
<h2 id="toc_3">The Second Kind: Human Rights Privacy</h2>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d849970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Human Rights Privacy (Anne Frank Photo 1942)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d849970d img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d849970d-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Human Rights Privacy (Anne Frank Photo 1942)" /></a>The second type of privacy is <strong><em>human rights privacy</em></strong>, which protects against existential threats resulting from information collection or theft. This is the territory of stalkers and other felonious criminals as well as authoritarian governments and other persons intent on doing damage to someone for personal for his or her beliefs or political views.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of human rights privacy is that violations usually result in more long-lasting losses than was the case with defensive privacy. Most obviously, authoritarian governments and hardline theocracies might imprison or kill victims while criminals might murder them. However, political groups could also ostracize or blacklist a victim.</p>
<p>In Europe, human rights privacy is one of the most <em>crucial</em> sorts of privacy. This comes from the continent&#39;s history: the Netherlands in the 1930s had a very comprehensive administrative census and registration of their own population that collected a lot of personal information. The Nazis captured this data within the first three days of occupation. <em>&quot;The Dark Side of Numbers&quot;</em> by William Seltzer and Margo Anderson (published in <em>Social Research</em> Vol. 68 No. 2 — Summer 2001), reports the inevitable result: Dutch Jews had the highest death rate (73 percent) of Jews residing in any occupied Western European country — far higher than the death rate among the Jewish population of Belgium (40 percent) or France (25 percent). Even the death rate in Germany was lower than in the Netherlands because the Jews there had avoided registration.</p>
<p>However, the issue of human rights privacy didn&#39;t end there. As Oxford professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberge explained in Jeffrey Toobin&#39;s <em>New Yorker</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/29/solace-oblivion">article</a>, Europe continued to experience serious human rights attacks during the Cold War. Mayer-Schönberge states: <em>&quot;With the Stasi, in East Germany, the task of capturing information and using it to further the power of the state is reintroduced and perfected by the society. So we had two radical ideologies, Fascism and Communism, and both end up with absolutely shockingly tight surveillance states.&quot;</em></p>
<p>In the United States, citizens are shielded from governmental abuses of human rights privacy by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment">Fourth Amendment</a>, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. As a result, I personally felt good about human rights privacy in the US — until the presidency of George W. Bush and his first attorney general, John Ashcroft. Under their watch, the Patriot Act dramatically increased the ability of the US government to surveil its citizens, with some of the worst mandates of that law making it illegal for the subject of the surveillance to even talk about being target.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, individuals aren&#39;t the only ones facing the governmental breach of human rights privacy in the US. Ever since the 1972 Supreme Court case, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11598860258825518787">Branzburg v. Hayes</a>, the press has also been fighting against governmental demands to reveal confidential sources and direct governmental assaults on sites like <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/surveillance-and-pressure-wikileaks-readers">WikiLeaks</a>. Some US states have created shield laws to protect the press&#39; privacy, but they&#39;re often not sufficient.</p>
<p>Today journalist James Risen faces jail for protecting a source. In a <a href="http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/13-1009.resp_.pdf">court filing</a>, Risen said <em>&quot;…this court should reconsider Branzburg because in recent years, subpoenas to journalists seeking the identity of confidential sources have &#39;become commonplace.&#39;&quot;</em> The Obama administration responded by stating, <em>&quot;…reporters have no privilege to refuse to provide direct evidence of criminal wrongdoing by confidential sources.&quot;</em> The US Supreme Court refused Risen&#39;s appeal in June 2014, leaving him on the hook for the information or jail time. Meanwhile, other journalists <a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/07/28/us-surveillance-harming-journalism-law-democracy">report</a> that surveillance is increasingly intimidating sources, making it hard to report on government activities.</p>
<p>On the bright side, these American governmental excesses are causing some corporations to consider how they can bolster the cause of human rights privacy: with the release of iOS8, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/">announced</a> that they would no longer have access to users&#39; mobile passcodes, making it nearly impossible for them to turn information over to the government. Google quickly followed on by making Android encryption easier for the public to access. Predictably, the US government isn&#39;t <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/30/holder-urges-tech-companies-to-leave-device-backdoors-open-for-police/">happy</a>, and security experts are <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/10/iphone_encrypti_1.html">nonplussed</a> by their complaints.</p>
<p>Though governments are the biggest actors on the stage of human rights breaches, individuals can also attack this sort of privacy — with cyberbullies being among the prime culprits. Though a bully&#39;s harassment <em>could</em> only involve words, the attackers frequently release personal information about the person they&#39;re harassing, which can cause the bullying to snowball. For example Jessica Logan, Hope Sitwell, and Amanda Todd were bullied after their nude pictures were broadcast, while Tyler Clementi was bullied after a hall-mate streamed video of Clementi kissing another young man. Unfortunately, cyberbullying often results in <a href="http://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/">suicide</a>, showing the existential dangers of these privacy breaches.</p>
<p>Even if threats aren&#39;t taken seriously, cyberbullying doubles back to the issue of defensive privacy, as revealed by Amanda Hess in her article <a href="http://www.psmag.com/navigation/health-and-behavior/women-arent-welcome-internet-72170/">&quot;Why Women Aren&#39;t Welcome on the Internet&quot;</a> where she wrote: <em>&quot;Threats of rape, death, and stalking can overpower our emotional bandwidth, take up our time, and cost us money through legal fees, online protection services, and missed wages.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Hess is just one of a long list of women who have been targeted by cyberbullies online. Programmer Kathy Sierra was largely driven out of the tech industry back in 2007 for being too influential; she recently wrote about how this is part of a long-standing <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/trolls-will-always-win">pattern</a> of purposeful violation.</p>
<p>This year, a study by <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Pew Research</a> revealed that about 25% of women aged 18–24 have been stalked or sexually harassed online — numbers far in excess of their male peers. It was a timely study because Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, and Brianna Wu all came under cyberbullying assault around the same time due to their positions as female leaders in the gaming field. When actress and gamer Felicia Day dared to speak out against this problem, her home address and personal email were revealed in a &quot;doxing&quot; <em>within an hour,</em> showing how fragile privacy is on the modern internet.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not surprising that some of my own female associates are unwilling to post pictures or other personal information online for fear of just this sort of attack. And we&#39;re relatively lucky in the western world: in a hardline theocracy like Afghanistan, a woman&#39;s need for privacy can be even stronger, with many women not willing to use their real names online — or a female name at all.</p>
<p>Individuals taking part in the democratic process can also come under a personal onslaught of this sort. This has gained prominence in California in recent years when numerous people have been called to task over their contributions to Prop 8, an anti-gay-marriage ballot measure that is now widely considered homophobic and bigoted. Brendan Eich, Mozilla&#39;s CEO, was forced out of his job as a result of such a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2014/04/brendan_eich_quits_mozilla_let_s_purge_all_the_antigay_donors_to_prop_8.html">contribution</a>. The fact that his donation was six years previous in a very different political climate shows how long-lasting this sort of damage can be. On the flip-side, the NRA has also been known to go after public figures with anti-gun views. Political repercussions of this sort are a more complex issue than simple cyberbullying, but they demonstrate another situation where individuals might wish they could assert their human rights privacy to shield themselves from damage.</p>
<h2 id="toc_4">The Third Kind: Personal Privacy</h2>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065861970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Personal Privacy (Cropped from original %22Don&#39;t Tread on Me%22 by DonkeyHotey on Flickr CC-BY-SA)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065861970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065861970c-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Personal Privacy (Cropped from original %22Don&#39;t Tread on Me%22 by DonkeyHotey on Flickr CC-BY-SA)" /></a>The third type of privacy is <strong><em>personal privacy</em></strong>, which protects persons against observation and intrusion; it&#39;s what Judge Thomas Cooley called <em>&quot;the right to be let alone&quot;</em>, as cited by future Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1321160">&quot;The Right to Privacy&quot;</a>, which he wrote for the <em>Harvard Law Review</em> of December 15, 1890. Brandeis&#39; championing of this sort of privacy would result in a new, uniquely American right that has at times been attributed to the First Amendment (giving freedom of speech within one&#39;s house), the Fourth Amendment (protecting one&#39;s house from search &amp; seizure by the government), and the Fifth Amendment (protecting one&#39;s private house from public use). This right can also be found in state Constitutions, such as the <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/.const/.article_1"><em>Constitution of California</em></a>, which promises <em>&quot;safety, happiness, and privacy&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>When personal privacy is breached we can lose <em>our right to be ourselves</em>. Without Brandeis&#39; protection, we could easily come under Panoptic observation where we could be forced to act unlike ourselves even in our personal lives. Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t just a theory: a recent PEN America survey shows that 1 in 6 authors already <a href="http://www.pen.org/chilling-effects">self-censor</a> due to NSA surveillance. Worse, it could be damaging: another report shows that unselfconscious time is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html?smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;_r=1">restorative</a> and that low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety can result from its lack.</p>
<p>Though Brandeis almost single-handedly created personal privacy, it didn&#39;t come easily. The Supreme Court refused to protect it in a 1928 wire-tapping case called <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5577544660194763070%29">Olmstead v. United States</a>; in response, Brandeis wrote a famous dissenting opinion that brought his ideas about privacy into the official record of the Court. Despite this initial loss, personal privacy gained advocates in the Supreme Court over the years, who often referred to Brandeis&#39; 1890 article. By the 1960s, Brandeis&#39; ideas were in the mainstream and in the 1967 Supreme Court case <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9210492700696416594">Katz v. United States</a>, Olmstead was finally overturned. Though the Court&#39;s opinion said that personal privacy was <em>&quot;left largely to the law of the individual States&quot;</em>, it had clearly become a proper expectation.</p>
<p>The ideas that Brandeis championed about personal privacy are shockingly modern. They focused on the Victorian equivalent of the paparazzi, as Brandeis made clear when he said: <em>&quot;Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life.&quot;</em> He also carefully threaded the interface between public and private, saying, <em>&quot;The right to privacy does not prohibit any publication of matter which is of public or general interest.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Today, personal privacy is the special concern of the more Libertarian-oriented founders of the Internet, such as Bit Torrent founder Bram Cohen, who demanded the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010710021553/http://bitconjurer.org/a_technological_activists_agenda.html">basic human rights</a> <em>&quot;to be free of intruders&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;to privacy&quot;</em>. Personal privacy is more of an issue than ever for celebrities and other public figures, but attacks upon it also touch the personal life of average citizens. It&#39;s the focus of the &quot;do not call&quot; registry and other telemarketing laws and of ordinances outlawing soliciting and trespass. It&#39;s the right at the heart of doing what we please in our own homes — whether it be eating dinner in peace, discussing controversial politics &amp; religion with our close friends, or playing sexual games with our partners.</p>
<p>Though personal privacy has grown in power in America since the 1960s, it&#39;s still under constant attack from the media, telemarketing interests, and the government. Meanwhile, it&#39;s not an absolute across the globe: some cultures, such as those in China and parts of Europe, actively preach against it — advocating that community and sharing trump personal privacy.</p>
<h2 id="toc_5"><strong>The Fourth Kind: Contextual Privacy</strong></h2>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d864970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Contextual Privacy (Post Secret #2 by Meg Wilis, licensed CC-BY) " class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d864970d img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d864970d-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Contextual Privacy (Post Secret #2 by Meg Wilis, licensed CC-BY) " /></a>The fourth type of privacy is <strong><em>contextual privacy</em></strong>, which protects persons against unwanted intimacy. This is what danah boyd calls <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2004/04/16/the_ickiness_factor.php%29"><em>&quot;The Ickiness Factor&quot;</em></a>:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ickiness is the guttural reaction that makes you cringe, scrunch your nose or gasp &#39;ick&#39; simply because there&#39;s something slightly off, something disconcerting, something not socially right about an interaction…. The ickiness factor is tightly coupled with issues [of] feeling vulnerable or getting the sense that someone else is vulnerable because of a given situation.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Failure to defend contextual privacy can result in the loss of relationships with others. No one presents the same persona in the office as they do when spending time with their kids or even when meeting with other parents. They speak different languages to each of these different &quot;tribes&quot;, and their connection to each tribe could be at risk if they mispoke by putting on the wrong persona or speaking the wrong language at the wrong time. Worse, the harm from this sort of privacy breach may also be increasing in the age of data mining, as bad actors can increasingly put together information from different contexts and twist them into a &quot;complete&quot; picture that simultaneously might be damning and completely false.</p>
<p>Though it&#39;s easy to understand what can be lost with a breach of contextual privacy, the concept can still be confusing because contextual privacy overlaps with other sorts of privacy; it could involve the theft of information or an unwelcome intrusion, but the result is different. Where theft of information might make you feel disadvantaged (if a conman stole your financial information) or endangered (if the government discovered you were whistle blowing), and where an intrusion might make you feel annoyed (if a telemarketer called during dinner), a violation of contextual privacy instead makes you feel emotionally uncomfortable and exposed — or as boyd said, &quot;vulnerable&quot;.</p>
<p>I believe that this feeling of vulnerability often comes from an inappropriate level of intimacy. Some of the more professional social networks seem particularly prone to it: I felt uncomfortable when I realized that my professional colleagues on one of the earliest social networks could see that I was in a committed relationship, and in turn I could see that some of them were in open marriages. Not that I had any problem with the information, but did I &quot;need to know&quot; in the context of business?</p>
<p>You probably won&#39;t find any case law about contextual privacy, because it&#39;s a fairly new concept and because there&#39;s less <em>obvious</em> harm. However social networks from Facebook and LinkedIn to Twitter and LiveJournal are all facing contextual privacy problems as they each try to become the home for <em>all</em> sorts of social interaction. This causes people — in particular women and members of the LGBT communities — to try and keep multiple profiles, only to find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543">&quot;real name&quot; policies</a> working against them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some social networks make things worse by creating artificial social pressures to reveal information, as occurs when someone tags you in a Facebook picture or in status update. To date, Google+ is one of the few networks to attempt a solution by creating <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/circles/">&quot;circles&quot;</a>, which can be used to precisely specify who in your social network should get each piece of information that you share. However, it&#39;s unclear how many people use this feature. A related feature on Facebook called &quot;Lists&quot; is rarely used.</p>
<p>If a lack of personal privacy causes you to <em>&quot;not be yourself&quot;</em>, a loss of contextual privacy allows other to <em>&quot;not see you as yourself&quot;</em>. You risk being perceived as <em>&quot;other&quot;</em> when your actions are seen out of context.</p>
<h2 id="toc_6"><strong>Case Studies</strong></h2>
<p>All four of these kinds of privacy can intersect. For example, some social networks allow you to reveal your sexual orientation, which could be used secretly by an employer to discriminate against you (<em>defensive privacy</em>) or by a future Ashcroftian government to violate your civil rights (<em>human rights privacy</em>). It might lead you to being bothered at home because of people who either agree with or disagree with your orientation (<em>personal privacy) _and often is an inappropriate revelation for casual professional acquaintances (</em>contextual privacy_).</p>
<p>Studies of current events offer more examples.</p>
<h3 id="toc_7"><strong>The First Case: Celebrity Hacking</strong></h3>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d870970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2013 X-Men (by Gage Skidmore. licensed CC-BY)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d870970d img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb0820d870970d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2013 X-Men (by Gage Skidmore. licensed CC-BY)" /></a>The recent unauthorized release of nude pictures of Jennifer Lawrence and others demonstrates the complex permutations of privacy.</p>
<p>To start with, it highlighted the problematic divide between public and private. There&#39;s no doubt that the pictures were intended to be private, and unlike some of the more troublesome uses of recording devices, these private situations <em>weren&#39;t</em> made public through the uncomfortable use of surveillance technology. Instead, the photos were publicized following theft. Unfortunately, now that they&#39;re in the public eye, they&#39;re unlikely to go away, ever. In other words, the genie&#39;s out of the bottle. All that the celebrities can do is make the photos less accessible by asserting their copyright (if they can to get search engines to de-link the information).</p>
<p>Perhaps Europe&#39;s Right to Be Forgotten will someday help to remove this type of occurrence from the internet. Or perhaps something like California&#39;s recent <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/13-14/bill/sen/sb_0251-0300/sb_255_bill_20130507_amended_sen_v98.html">SB 255</a> might make it illegal to distribute nude photos without the model&#39;s permission. Alternatively, it could be social mores that win out, if we follow <em>&quot;the ethics of looking away&quot;</em>, as advocated by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/09/leaked-photos-nude-celebrities-abuse/379434/">Jessica Valenti</a>); Jennifer Lawrence herself agreed there are ethical problems, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/2014/10/jennifer-lawrence-cover">saying</a>: <em>&quot;Anybody who looked at those pictures, you&#39;re perpetuating a sexual offense.&quot;</em> However for now, the pictures are out there <em>and</em> being viewed.</p>
<p>When considering the four kinds of privacy, these celebrities primarily suffered from an unwanted intimacy with the entire world (<em>contextual privacy</em>). Lawrence explained the problem succinctly, saying: <em>&quot;I didn&#39;t tell you that you could look at my naked body.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Celebrities and other high-profile victims might also face financial repercussions (<em>defensive privacy</em>). Ariana Grande was one of the younger victims of the theft and one of the few to risk the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisand Effect</a> by saying her photos weren&#39;t authentic. She should never have had to make such a statement one way or the other, but one understands why she would: as a teen pop star recently featured on a pair of Nickelodeon shows, she risks the greatest fiscal damage of any of the victims. But even Lawrence worried, stating: <em>&quot;I didn&#39;t know how this would affect my career.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Kevin Sullivan offered some of the most adroit commentary on the theft when he <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1918278/jennifer-lawrence-photos-not-a-scandal/">said</a> <em>&quot;Don&#39;t call it a scandal&quot;</em>. By calling this a scandal and smugly shaking our heads, we&#39;re blaming the victims, not the criminals. Worse, we&#39;re embarking on a slippery slope where we suggest that people take away their own freedoms through self-censorship. By calling it a scandal, we are saying that even in their own homes, using their own cameras, these people shouldn&#39;t be themselves (<em>personal privacy</em>).</p>
<h3 id="toc_8"><strong>The Second Case: #GamerGate</strong></h3>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065886970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Zoe Quinn (by Zoe Quinn, licensed CC-BY-SA)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065886970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1065886970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Zoe Quinn (by Zoe Quinn, licensed CC-BY-SA)" /></a>The widespread and ongoing harassment of game designer Zoe Quinn is a somewhat frightening example for its intense focus on the repeated privacy violations of a single person.</p>
<p>It started with a blog post by Quinn&#39;s ex-boyfriend that accused her of infidelity. This once more highlights the troubled modern divide between public and private. Though some countries <em>might</em> protect the release of information of this sort using defamation laws, it seems unlikely that the US&#39;s slander or libel laws would do so. Despite the likely legality of that initial post, the public still learned inappropriate information about Quinn (<em>contextual privacy</em>).</p>
<p>However, worse privacy violations followed: the online community 4chan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing">doxed</a> Quinn by collecting considerable semi-public information about her (more <em>contextual privacy)</em>, which allowed online harassment to evolve into threatening phone calls (<em>human rights privacy</em>). The information revealed during the harassment included the fact that Quinn had dated a game industry journalist, which could impact Quinn&#39;s ability to sell games in the future or even to get reviewed (<em>defensive privacy</em>). Obviously, the continual harassment has also violated Quinn&#39;s personal space and her right to be let alone (<em>personal privacy</em>).</p>
<p>Following the initial assaults on Quinn, the #GamerGate mob has moved on to harass other female game designers, including Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna Wu, as well as gamer and actress Felicia Day — all using the same privacy-busting methodology of cyberbullying and doxing. The movement may have reached its height when terrorist threats were made against a talk planned by Sarkeesian, forcing her to cancel it.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, it was difficult for groups of individuals to work together to violate the privacy rights of an individual; there also wasn&#39;t a medium that could be used to publish personal details about someone unless there was a clear public interest. The cyberbullying stemming from #GamerGate shows that&#39;s all changed in the modern age. Which is why privacy is such a major concern for so many people on the internet.</p>
<h3 id="toc_9"><strong>The Third Case: The NSA</strong></h3>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1c6970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="National_Security_Agency" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1c6970b img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1c6970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="National_Security_Agency" /></a>Though it&#39;s become very easy for individuals to violate the privacy of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence or individuals like Zoe Quinn, the government has also been stepping up its act in the 21st century, especially since 9/11. In the United States, it&#39;s the NSA who&#39;s been at the heart of the privacy controversies (with a little help from their friends in the FBI).</p>
<p>Many of the new privacy-busting powers of these organizations originated with the USA <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ56/pdf/PLAW-107publ56.pdf">Patriot Act</a>, but follow-up laws like the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-121/pdf/STATUTE-121-Pg552.pdf">Protect America Act</a> of 2007 and the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">FISA Amendment Act</a> of 2008 are equally invasive. We only know how these laws are actually being utilized thanks to the whistle-blowing of Edward Snowden and others.</p>
<p>Most obviously, these types of laws have allowed the collection of private data in large quantities (<em>human rights privacy</em>). We now know that the NSA uses a previously secret program called <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/12/heres-everything-we-know-about-prism-to-date/">PRISM</a> to coordinate data collection using court orders and that they also appear to have broken into <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html">communication links</a> to tap major data centers. There are claims that they also <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-11/nsa-said-to-have-used-heartbleed-bug-exposing-consumers.html">exploited the Heartbleed bug</a> for years in order to collect data, though they deny this. The human rights repercussions of this multi-pronged, largely unfettered data collection are mind-boggling.</p>
<p>One of the most worrisome issues with this sort of large-scale data collection is that it can result in mistakes when something is taken out of context (<em>contextual privacy</em>). Someone might feel like they have nothing to fear from the government — until they&#39;re arrested for something they said while roleplaying in an MMORPG. Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t an unfounded concern: Snowden&#39;s whistleblowing revealed that the NSA spies on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-10/nsa-infiltrating-online-video-games-leaked-documents-show/5147394">video game chats</a>!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this type of contextual disconnect has already caused problems in other legal contexts, such as when firefighter Lt. Philip Lyons was falsely charged with arson based on the purchase of a <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2002055245_arson06m.html">fire-starter</a> that was revealed through loyalty card records. Reports similarly indicate that the FBI was tracking the sale of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071221122513/http://cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&amp;docID=hsnews-000002620892">Middle Eastern foods</a> in San Francisco as a terrorist-finding tool.</p>
<p>The European Union has much more mature protections against data collection of this sort, thanks to the Data Protection Directive of 1995, which is now in the process of being <a href="http://www.apple.com/">reformed</a>. Sadly, the US has only responded in a piecemeal way that largely depends on private corporations&#39; privacy policies.</p>
<p>Returning to the US, we find that many of these data collection and spying laws have been wrapped up with authoritarian regulations that go after individuals — such as one of Edward Snowden&#39;s email providers, LavaBit founder Ladar Levison.</p>
<p>Levison wrote an article about his interactions with the FBI that reads like an <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email">Orwellian parody</a>. He described how the FBI served him papers seven times and forced him to appear in a court 1,000 miles from home without an attorney as part of their heavy-handed attempt to acquire Snowden&#39;s encryption keys. His company, LavaBit, was eventually shut down as a result. Because Levison tried to protect the privacy of one of his customers, he was threatened with jail and <a href="http://www.apple.com/">compelled to silence</a> (<em>personal privacy</em>). Even Yahoo&#39;s CEO Marissa Meyer is personally worried about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/11/yahoo-ceo-mayer-jail-nsa-surveillance">trend</a>. She says tech companies aren&#39;t talking more about the government&#39;s surveillance because they&#39;re afraid: <em>&quot;Releasing classified information is treason and you are incarcerated.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The issue of compelled silence arises from the National Security Letters authorized by the USA Patriot Act. It&#39;s particularly troublesome because it threatens democracy just as much as a lack of voting anonymity would. Because the Letters can&#39;t be discussed, there&#39;s no way to assess whether the government is doing a good job or not — and thus no way to punish a government at the voting booth if they&#39;re stepping over the line.</p>
<h3 id="toc_10"><strong>The Fourth Case: Americans in Afghanistan</strong></h3>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1ca970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Afgan Social Media Summit (cropped, original by Luisa Whalmsey, licensed CC-BY)" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1ca970b img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c77cd1ca970b-500wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Afgan Social Media Summit (cropped, original by Luisa Whalmsey, licensed CC-BY)" /></a>My final case study is a personal one. I&#39;ve regularly taught &quot;Digital Influence&quot; and &quot;Using the Social Web for Social Change&quot; classes in the Bainbridge Graduate Institute&#39;s <a href="http://bgi.pinchot.edu/">MBA in Sustainable Systems</a> program at Pinchot University. One of my students there was Luisa Walmsley.</p>
<p>While at BGI, Luisa met a woman who had co-founded Afghanistan&#39;s largest telecommunications company. Luisa later went to work at the company, then started her own consultancy doing operations and business development for Afghan media and technology companies — in the process helping women in Afghanistan to become better entrepreneurs. She&#39;s also been involved with Afghanistan&#39;s first-ever <a href="http://socialmediasummit.af/">social media summit</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, being a female professional in Afghanistan can still be quite dangerous. Women have only been able to widely reenter the work force in the last decade, since the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban, and today they are sometimes still attacked or threatened for doing so. This makes Luisa&#39;s need for privacy important (<em>human rights privacy</em>).</p>
<p>Luisa&#39;s situation also demonstrates the sorts of divides you can find in a human rights privacy case. While in Afghanistan, Luisa follows basic security procedures to protect her privacy from both terrorists and the government — such as varying the times of day that she travels to the office. She&#39;s still willing to use social media but is careful, for example occasionally lying about her location or not talking about her travel plans or waiting days to post pictures that might reveal information as to her whereabouts. However Luisa has to be even more careful with the human rights concerns of the women she&#39;s working with, who could be assaulted or killed for their decision to make a career for themselves.</p>
<p>Even outside of her work proper, Luisa has run into other sorts of privacy issues in Afghanistan. She was once asked by an Afghan government agency to remove a Facebook post that reprinted an international organization&#39;s security alert concerning elections security, which she&#39;d reposted in order to warn her friends. She&#39;s also received phone harassment (<em>personal privacy</em>) that would be unthinkable in the US: in Afghanistan men cold call phone numbers and when they hear a woman&#39;s voice on the other side, they continuously call back. Luisa was often able to stop the calls, but some of her female friends would receive over 200 harassing phone calls of this sort a day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Luisa&#39;s work also runs straight back into the privacy problems originating with the NSA. In 2013, the NSA admitted that they tracked phone calls of people <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/you-may-already-be-a-winner-in-nsas-three-degrees-surveillance-sweepstakes/">&quot;two to three hops&quot; away</a> from suspected terrorists. However in Afghanistan, <em>everyone</em> working in human rights or in the media is going to have some <em>direct</em> contact with the Taliban. Luisa surely has (one hop), so as soon as she calls or emails me (two hops), I&#39;m suddenly in the NSA jackpot (more <em>human rights privacy</em>). And how does the NSA get that information? In 2014 we learned that they&#39;re recording nearly all domestic <em>and</em> international <a href="https://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-statement-on-the-mass.html">phone calls in Afghanistan</a> (massive <em>human rights privacy</em>).</p>
<p>Because we know that the FBI once though it was relevant to track falafel sales, and because I gained an appreciation for Middle Eastern music 15 years ago, I could easily become a serious terror suspect myself (yet more <em>human rights privacy</em>). Worse, if you&#39;re reading this article (<em>three hops</em>), you now might be in the NSA&#39;s sights too. Hope you don&#39;t like <em>hummus</em> or <em>baba ghannouj</em>!</p>
<h2 id="toc_11"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Privacy is important — perhaps more so than ever due to the assaults by con artists, governments, the press, and social media in the 21st century. However, in order to protect your own privacy, you must define your terms.</p>
<p>First, that requires: understanding the difference between private and public; considering how to prevent information from escaping from the one to the other; and thinking about how that might interact with free speech.</p>
<p>Second, it requires understanding the different kinds of privacy, and figuring out which one is most topical to you.</p>
<p>• Is it <strong><em>defensive privacy?</em></strong>_ W_here you worry about conmen, phishers, or other thieves stealing from you? Do you fear the finances loss?</p>
<p>• Is it <strong><em>human rights privacy?</em></strong>_ W_here you&#39;re threatened by the actions of a government or other entity? Do you fear the loss of your life or your freedom?</p>
<p>• Is it <strong><em>personal privacy?</em></strong> Where you just want to be be left alone? Do you fear the loss of the freedom to be yourself?</p>
<p>• Is it <strong><em>contextual privacy?</em></strong> Where you want to partition different portions of your life? Do you fear the loss of your relationships?</p>
<p>Most people will have some concerns about multiple sorts of privacy, but there will probably be one or two that strike a chord.</p>
<p>So what&#39;s important to you?</p>

<p>Since then I&#39;ve seen a number of different versions of her list of the 8 principles for effectively managing against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" target="_self" title="Wikipedia Page for The Tragedy of the Commons">the tragedy of the commons</a>. However, I&#39;ve found&#0160;her original words — as well as many adaptions I&#39;ve seen since — to be not very accessible. Also, since the original release of the list of 8 principles there has been some research resulting in updates and clarifications to her original list.</p>
<p>This last weekend, at two very different events — one on the <a href="http://www.futureofworking.org" target="_self" title="Future of Working Summit">future of working</a>&#0160;and the other on the <a href="http://crypto.sabir.cc/?page_id=237" target="_self">future of the block chain</a>&#0160;(used by technologies like bitcoin) — I wanted to share these principles. However, I was unable to effectively articulate them.</p>
<p>So&#0160;I decided to take an afternoon to re-read the original, as well as more contemporary adaptions, to see if I could summarize this into a list of effective design principles. I also wanted to generalize them for broader use as I often apply them to everything from how to manage an online community to how a business should function with competitors.</p>
<p>I ended up with 10 principles, each beginning with a verb-oriented commandment, followed by the design principle itself.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>DEFINE BOUNDARIES:</strong> There are clearly defined boundaries around the common resources of a system from the larger environment.</li>
<li><strong>DEFINE LEGITIMATE USERS:</strong> There is a clearly defined community of legitimate users of those resources.</li>
<li><strong>ADAPT LOCALLY:</strong> Rules for use of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions.</li>
<li><strong>DECIDE INCLUSIVELY:</strong> Those using resources are included in decision making.</li>
<li><strong>MONITOR EFFECTIVELY:</strong> There exists effective monitoring of the system by accountable monitors.</li>
<li><strong>SHARE KNOWLEDGE:</strong> All parties share knowledge of local conditions of the system.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD ACCOUNTABLE:</strong> Have graduated sanctions for those who violate community rules.</li>
<li><strong>OFFER MEDIATION:</strong> Offer cheap and easy access to confict resolution.</li>
<li><strong>GOVERN LOCALLY:</strong> Community self-determination is recognized by higher-level authorities.</li>
<li><strong>DON&#39;T EXTERNALIZE COSTS:</strong> Resource systems embedded in other resource systems are organized in and accountable to multiple layers of nested communities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I welcome your thoughts on ways to improve on this summarized list. In particular, in #10 I&#39;d like to find a better way to express its complexity (the original is even more obtuse).</p>

I love it Chris.  Our conversation this morning was about playing the role of the "translator."  You work fast.

Quick notes:
#7 has a typo (sanction).

Could number 10 be rephrased as Internalize Externalities? (that may be even more abstract)

And at what level is ten really about feedback loops> -- particularly since resources actual "cost" can be hard to even estimate, particularly when those resources are the result of thousands of years of natural processes (ex: oil, or fertile soil).

Christopher, let me suggest the following revisions to items 3, 5, and 10, based on: 
Cox, M., G. Arnold, and S. Villamayor Tomás. 2010. A review of design principles for community-based natural resource management. Ecology and Society 15(4): 38. [online] URL: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol15/iss4/art38/

3.	ESTABLISH LOCALLY　APPROPRIATE RULES　FOR　USING AND MAINTAINING RESOURCES: Rules for use and maintenance of resources are adapted to local needs and conditions, and provide benefits to users that are correlated to their level of inputs.

5.	EFFECTIVELY MONITOR RESOURCES AND USERS: There exists effective monitoring of the system by monitors who are accountable to the users.

10.	TIE-IN TO RELATED SYSTEMS: The resource system is appropriately connected to parent/fraternal/subordinate resource groups and to governmental systems.

Excellent version. I think a critical adaptation is the active voice, as you've done in the bold verbs. 

#10 expresses a dynamic relationship with #9, yes? Thus, "govern locally" (or "organize locally") is in relation to "don't externalize costs." That is, within holarchies or (spatially, temporally, institutionally) nested set of commons or jurisdictions, both other levels and other holarchies are recognized and respected. Perhaps the positive flip on "don't externalize costs" would be "seek to externalize benefits"? In other words, seek to transmit one's learnings from such local organization up the holarchy and across to other holarchies. Like Ostrom did, and one seeks to do, by developing design principles!

<p>Between the business of the March/April conference season and leaving Blackphone, I've run out of business cards. Rather than rush to print a bunch of new ones, I'm created this mini-resume for digital sharing and a two-sided Avery business card version that I am printing on my laser printer and sharing.</p>
<p>Not as pretty as my old Life With Alacrity cards, but effective in getting across the diversity of my professional experience and interests.</p>

<p>As someone who teaches Personal Branding in my courses at BGI@Pinchot.edu, I always find it hard to practice as I preach to ask for advice and suggestions. In this case I'm trying to tame my three-headed Cerebus of a profession with Privacy/Crypto/Developer Community, an Innovative Business Educator/Instructional Designer head, and my Collaborative Tools, Processes, Games and Play head. All come tied together in my body as ultimately being about collaboration, but it is hard to explain some of the correspondences.</p>

Yes, it uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok">Star Trek episode</a> as an allegory, it is a bit confusing and has a lot of complexity and depth, but it is a good introduction to a topic I care about — <em><strong>Deep Context Shared Languages</strong></em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I consider one of my missions in life to be to &quot;create tools that allow people to communicate about complexity&quot;. There are many problems to address and many possible solutions to those problems. My <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/InfiniteCanvasSuite/">Infinite Canvas Suite</a>&#0160;</span>app tries&#0160;to address problems of linearity. Another way to manage complexity is facilitating the creation and learning of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2009/09/creating-shared-language-and-shared-artiifacts.html">Shared Languages</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of what Shared Language is is tribal — it has an elemental power to help a group form. But what a shared language also does is allow a group to take shortcuts. For instance, with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GroupWorksDeck/"><span class="s2">Group Works Deck</span></a> Pattern Language, I can say the phrase &quot;Viewpoint Shift&quot; and practitioners know that I mean <em>&quot;Step from your usual perspective into another in order to better understand someone, shift energy, reframe meanings, open up new ideas, or simply see a situation with new eyes.&quot;</em> But they also know more than that — they can connect that concept to their own experience of doing this practice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first time I was introduced to this concept was by expert facilitator and futurist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RMattTaylor"><span class="s2">Matt Taylor</span></a>, who has in his communities a Shared Language concept called a &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot;, which is from a story by Herman Hess. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glass_Bead_Game">Wikipedia cites it</a>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&quot;The Glass Bead Game is &quot;a kind of synthesis of human learning&quot; in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated. As the Game progresses, associations between the themes become deeper and more varied.&quot;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1e211d8970c-75wi" style="width: 60px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Solution Box, Insight, Philosophy, Schematic Design" /></a>When you know the shared language of Matt&#39;s community, you can express concisely &quot;In the SOLUTION BOX I am at INSIGHT, PHILOSOPHY and SCHEMATIC DESIGN.&quot; Which means, in other words, <em>&quot;I have a mature idea that I feel is a synthesis of all the challenges inherent in the project, I can talk about it with some clarity and express it as a visual solution. I have done a lot of work yet I do not have a buildable design.&quot;</em> Someone familiar with the language can then respond in kind, rather than coming from a different perspective in the solution box and think that I have built something that is ready for production.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes hash tags are a more contemporary expression that there may exist a Deep Context. For instance, just saying <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/glassbeadgame?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">GlassBeadGame</span></a> is a challenge for someone to respond in kind with a model of their own. Hash tags like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/intrapreneuring?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">Intrapreneuring</span></a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/freedomtofail?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">FreedomToFail</span></a> also have&#0160;Deep Contexts with different communities. If someone says to me <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cynefin?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=10152490318630540"><span class="s3">#‎</span><span class="s4">Cynefin</span></a> I know that we share an understanding with me about the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_Framework">&quot;complicated&quot; vs &quot;complex&quot; </a>and how to work with each.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what makes for great deep context shared languages? I don&#39;t know, but this article touches on it. It is more than just metaphor, more than allegory, more than meme. But if we can figure out how to create and teach it, it may be a powerful tool for communicating about complexity.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">KEYQUOTE: &quot;Here we might distinguish between the invocation of a particular logic and the simulation of a creature, thing, or idea by replicating its image. The simulation of life in art often concerns the reproduction of surfaces: in painting, the appearance of form, perspective, or the rendition of light; in literature the appearance of character or event; in photography and cinema the rendition of the world as it appears through optical element and upon emulsion or sensor; in theater the rendition of the behavior of a character or situation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While all these examples “simulate” to various extents, they do so by a process of rendering. For example, the writer might simulate a convincing verbal intercourse by producing a credibility that allows the reader to take it as reality. Likewise, the actor might render a visible behavior or intonation that is suggestive of a particular emotion, event, or history that the theatrical or cinematic viewer takes as evidence for some unseen motivation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A logic is also a behavior, but it is a behavior unlike the behavior of the literary or theatrical character, for whom behaving involves producing an outward sign of some deeper but abstracted motivation, understanding, or desire. By contrast logics are pure behaviors. They are abstract and intangible and yet also real.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we pretend that “Shaka, when the walls fell” is a signifier, then its signified&#0160;not by the fictional mythological character Shaka, nor the myth that contains whatever calamity caused the walls to fall, but the logic by which the situation itself came about. Tamarian language isn’t really language at all, but machinery.&quot;</span></p>

BODY:
<p>For the second time, I was asked to play a hand pan solo on stage at the BGIedu intensive. This time I was better prepared to make a better quality recording.</p>
<p>For those who want more detail, this percussion instrument is generically called a hand pan, and specifically this a Pantheon Steel Halo Genesis tuned in the Xiao Xiong Diao (XXD) scale. A cousin of the PanArt hand pan called a "Hang", the makers of this instrument are one of the first to successfully make an instrument of similar quality. This specific instrument was the 14th created and tuned by Kyle Cox of Pantheon Steel in August of 2009, of what is now known as the "Genesis" line of their hand pans, and in my opinion is one of his early master works. The tuning was inspired by an asian scale called Xiao Xiong Diao (XXD). This means the central ding is a C, followed by 8 notes around the edge F G Ab C D Eb F and G.</p>
<p>This particular piece is a structured improv in 6 taking advantage of the multiple harmonics available to a single notes on the instrument depending on how you strike it, thus is titled "Harmonic".</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qlNV22sSiw0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

If you like hand pans, I have an extensive playlist of good quality hand pan performances on YouTube.

BODY:
<p>Regarding the Heartbleed bug, SSL and TLS vendors used to require code security reviews before CAs would accept certificate requests from that implementation.</p>
<p>My firm Consensus Development was the only one offering these reviews, largely because other security firms were scared of liability issues. Over 50% of the products failed in less then 8 hours of review, typically for very stupid mistakes. The CAs stopped asking us for reviews because it was slowing down sales of certificates.</p>
<p>I believe that we would have found last month&#39;s Apple bug if we reviewed it. Maybe not Heartbleed, but we were doing these security reviews TWENTY years ago. If we had kept at it we would have created better tools by now.</p>
<p>It may be time for CAs to require vendors to pay for implementation security reviews again, or only offer a lower level certificate. They also need to indemnify security reviewers so that they can do this kind of work without fear of being sued for not finding a bug (hard to prove a negative). And there should be a pool of funding to do independent security reviews of open source.</p>
<p>The amazing Tim Dierks , author of SSLRef, the reference implementation of SSL 3.0, co-author IETF TLS 1.0 standard and subsequent updates, and later creator of Google Wallet, did all of these reviews for us back then. Any memories, comments, or suggestion to add?</p>

Actually, the implication of the study is that argument, as the term is conventionally understood, is a myth and that persuasion is functionally impossible.  Also that nobody knows anything, nor can they.

<p><em>(by Christopher Allen with Elyn Andersson and Shannon Appelcline)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.BGI.edu" style="float: right;"><img alt="BGIedu Logo" border="0" height="100" src="http://www.bgi.edu/files/BGI-Logomark-CMYK.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" width="100" /></a>Two years ago, the Bainbridge Graduate Institute (<a href="http://www.BGI.edu" target="_self" title="Bainbridge Graduate Institute">www.BGI.edu</a>) faculty gathered to radically reinvent their sustainable business curriculum for the next decade. Our goal was not only to update course content, but also to significantly update how the material was taught. We wished to make our teaching process (our pedagogy) more interactive and also more effective for students graduating into a 21st-century work environment, where people increasingly work in teams-both online and offline.</p>
<p>As a specialist in group interactions, I was asked by the faculty whether formal graduate student study groups (called &quot;Study Buddies&quot;) should consist of two people or of three. I did not have an easy answer to this question.</p>
<p>My expertise with group dynamics comes from professional experience as an entrepreneur and from considerable experience both building online communities and helping others to do the same. Through these processes, I&#39;ve seen how groups of people act differently at different sizes. As I discussed in my previous blog post on Group Thresholds [<a href="#Allen">Allen</a>], there are pros and cons associated with different group sizes. However, the smallest group that I spoke of in that article was the &#39;working team size&#39;, which is a group of four to nine members (but ideally about seven). I didn&#39;t talk about groups consisting of less than four members-specifically dyads (a group of two people) and triads (a group of three people)-and that was what the BGIedu faculty was now interested in learning more about.</p>
<p>My first inclination when considering BGIedu&#39;s request was to say that triads would be the best size for study groups, but I wasn&#39;t sure. I knew from my past research on group size that a dyad has a significantly different behavior than any other small groups. However, I wasn&#39;t certain if triads should also be considered on their own, or if they were just the low end of one of those &#39;work teams&#39;, which I&#39;d always thought of as containing four to nine members. Triads were a hole in my research.</p>
<p>I decided to dig deeper into this question by engaging my teaching assistant Elyn Andersson and my writing partner Shannon Appelcline to help me investigate further. This post is the fruit of our research and our discussions about dyads and triads. We hope it might help you decide whether a dyad or a triad is the better team size for groups that you are working in.</p>
<h1><a id="choosing" name="choosing"></a>Choosing between Dyads and Triads</h1>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c3859329f970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Pythagorian Dyad - Public Domain" /></a>Before I share with you the details of our investigation, I want to be clear that dyads, triads, and small &#39;working team&#39; groups can all be effective. Any challenge faced by groups of these sizes can be overcome by a good process, teamwork, training, or just positive energy. However, my thesis is that certain sizes of groups are better for certain purposes-and when a group size is selected appropriately it will require less energy and thus be more likely to be productive when the inevitable group challenges occur. When choosing among a dyad, a triad, or a working team, the important thing to focus on is thus the intent in forming the group.</p>
<p>For the groups being considered by BGIedu, the faculty felt that the students taking the new curriculum needed three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More formal support for studying (i.e. not ad hoc study teams);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inclusion of emotional support in that support structure; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system where the members of a study group would help each other to keep their commitments to study.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last requirement - that members of these study teams would be accountable to each other without one student just taking up the slack of another - was the toughest one.</p>
<p>Clearly, working teams of 4-9 people were too large for our purposes. Teams this size are rarely intimate enough to support the needs of individuals. In addition, research shows that they are poor at supporting accountability. That&#39;s because working teams of 4-9 are very vulnerable to social loafing (i.e., slackers)-except when the tasks assigned to these working teams are highly independent (i.e. an entrepreneurial team that has different members focused on different topics, such as management, development, operations, marketing and sales) or when they require high diversity. An upcoming blog will cover this topic in more depth.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef017c38593410970b-800wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Pythagorian Triad - Public Domain" /></a>Removing working teams left the question of dyad vs. triad - which our research would show were both very different from working teams. Triads ultimately fit BGIedu&#39;s particular need better. That was primarily due to advantages of accountability and cohesion, combined with some emotional support. However, some simple numerical properties of triads also prove useful: they have elemental diversity because they&#39;re up to 50% more diverse than dyads; and if someone misses a team meeting the other two-thirds of the team can still benefit. For all of these reasons, my recommendation to the BGIedu faculty was that these formal study teams be formed in triads.</p>
<p>Dyads, however, are quite appropriate for a variety of other purposes, and should not be dismissed. I&#39;ll be talking of some of their advantages before proceeding on to the lessons learned about triads themselves.</p>
<h1><a id="dyad" name="dyad"></a>The Dyad</h1>
<p>Everyone has had experience with dyads. The first social experience of anyone&#39;s life is a dyadic relationship - that between a mother and her unborn child. This parent-child relationship continues once the child is born. Overall, dyads are the most common social group; they are seen everywhere, in personal, academic and business relationships.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94611163@N00/683866337/" style="float: right;"><img alt="Great Guitar Duo — Photo by Tom706 CC-BY-NC-ND" border="0" src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1108/683866337_4dd654b650_n.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>To decide if a dyad is the best group size for your needs, it is again important to focus on the purpose of the group. A number of interesting characteristics of dyads - some benefits and some limitations - make them unique from triads and other larger group sizes, among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Emotional Support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commitment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoned Agreement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power Inequality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group Accountability</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="emotional_support" name="emotional_support"></a>Emotional Support</h2>
<p>There have been some academic studies [<a href="#Taylor">Taylor</a>] that suggest that it&#39;s easier to be open and share within dyads. The research has shown that people feel safer about revealing personal and intimate information in a dyad than they do when a third person is added to the group. As a result, disclosure rates increase when people are put into dyads as compared to triads. Furthermore, adding a third person to a group causes its members to be more socially conscious, making it harder for members to listen to the conversation and at the same time be aware of their own thoughts.</p>
<p>Together it&#39;s this trust level (allowing for disclosure) and this focus level (allowing for better listening) that make dyads much stronger for emotional support than triads or larger teams. If the intent of a group is to have an intimate and fully open space, or if the work of the group is emotional in nature, this might make dyads a better choice.</p>
<p>Though dyads are clearly more effective for providing emotional support, triads can still offer that as well under the right conditions.</p>
<h2><a id="commitment" name="commitment"></a>Commitment</h2>
<p>This intimacy and confidentiality of a dyad helps its members to build strong team dynamics relatively quickly. The two individuals not only will have formed a trust bond more easily than three or more individuals could, but they generally will have a better ratio of time to performance outcomes compared to groups of larger sizes, in part because less time is spent maintaining the team relationship itself.</p>
<p>In a triad or larger group, the group would need to put effort towards team work over task work and thus less time is put towards performing the task. In other words, more resources would be spent on relating to a teammate than on finishing a project.</p>
<h2><a id="reasoned_agreement" name="reasoned_agreement"></a>Reasoned Agreement</h2>
<p>The most unique element of dyads is that they are the only group size in which one voice is paired against another voice equally.</p>
<p>When was the last time you were in dyad in which you did not agree on an issue? Most likely, you and the other individual spent some considerable time trying to convince the other of your reasons, and the outcome was one of two things: you either both stuck with your opinion and walked away, or one of you changed your mind after hearing the other&#39;s ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>Because members can&#39;t &#39;vote&#39;, a dyad is either in agreement or disagreement, which forces a longer deliberation for tasks when consensus is required. There are times when you want a small group to deliberate deeply, and dyads are ideal for this.</p>
<h2><a id="power_inequality" name="power_inequality"></a>Power Inequality</h2>
<p>Though dyads have several advantages, they can also bring with them a few additional problems - one of which is a power inequality of knowledge that would be detrimental within some teams. For some tasks, this could offset the benefits of having a more intimate small group. For my BGIedu groups, I was concerned that it might prevent some students from benefiting academically from the study exercise.</p>
<p>This topic has been addressed in a study <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289604000972">[</a><a href="#Day" target="_self" title="Day">Day</a>] that compared homogeneous teams that were entirely high-ability or low-ability to heterogeneous dyads of mixed abilities. The study found that while high-ability people tested better individually after learning the material in a dyad with another high-ability team mate, low-ability people did not gain much benefit from studying in a dyad with a high-ability team member.</p>
<p>This was somewhat surprising. A student with more knowledge of a subject should be able to mentor a student with less knowledge, therefore creating a true dyad study partner. However, this study showed that this was not the case.</p>
<p>The study also argued against another common conception. One might assume that two high-ability team members could learn more together, when they could bounce ideas off of each other, than they could alone. However, this was again not the case: high-ability individuals performed better after learning alone than after learning with another high-ability team member! Only homogeneous low-ability teammates performed better after being in a dyad than alone.</p>
<p>This study pushed me toward triads for study teams at BGIedu, as dyads would not be large enough to guarantee high performance outcomes; the teams would always consist of one higher performing student and one lower performing student.</p>
<h2><a id="group_accountability" name="group_accountability"></a>Group Accountability</h2>
<p>Another disadvantage of dyads shows up in the area of accountability. The simplest version of this issue can be shown in this question: if one teammate says she did the majority of the work, while the other teammate says the work was shared 50/50, who was correct? A tougher question: if they both say that the work was shared 50/50, how is a third party able to determine if this actually was true?</p>
<p>Elyn, my teaching assistant, interned in a high school in Seattle while working towards her Master&#39;s in Teaching. Her experiences highlight this problem. In today&#39;s educational model, collaborative learning is highly valued, and Elyn worked to incorporate in-class group work into many of her lessons. When assessing the students&#39; group projects, however, she found that it was difficult to determine if the students shared the work equitably or if some of the students rode on the hard work of their partners. In some cases, Elyn doubted that the work was split equally. In particular, she found that if she let the students choose their own partners, the students were more likely to say that &#39;both&#39; did the work, rather than tell the teacher their friend slacked off on the assignment.</p>
<p>A recent study [<a href="#Alkaslassy" target="_self">Alkaslassy</a>]&#0160;supports Elyn&#39;s experience. In it, students working on a paired group assignment were asked to allocate the percent of work done between the pair. 86% of the students assigned equal credit between the two individuals in the group. At a surface level, one could presume that each party performed half the work and was honest in their assignment of credit. However, Elyn and I believe that in some dyadic relationships, friendship can become an overriding factor and that in those situations, students are more likely to allocate equal credit because of this friendship, not because of true equity.</p>
<p>In the psychological field, this relates to a well-known cognitive bias called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egocentric_bias" target="_self" title="Wikipedia: Egocentric Bias">egocentric bias</a>, where an individual will claim more responsibility for group action then an independent observer would credit them. Although this is most often discussed for larger groups, in dyads a member might rate their own efforts as being half of the effort when in fact is it is less. Thus in academic group projects, it can sometimes be more effective to have the students rate their peer rather than themselves.</p>
<p>Though group accountability can be a disadvantage for dyads, it improves when you have triads, thanks in part to a triad&#39;s inability to devolve. This, as it turns out, would be another comparative advantage that helped me choose triads over dyads for BGIedu.</p>
<h1><a id="triads" name="triads"></a>Triads</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yaketyyakyak/5991422366/in/photostream/" style="float: right;"><img alt="Fernando&#39;s Kitchen, Cambridge 30-07-11 —&#0160;Photo by Dave Catchpole CC-BY" border="0" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6123/5991422366_6301a83c43_n.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>There are a number of interesting characteristics of triads that make them different from dyads and also from small &#39;working team&#39; groups. I&#39;ll talk about three of them in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inability to Devolve</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elemental Diversity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="inability_to_devolve" name="inability_to_devolve"></a>Inability to Devolve</h2>
<p>We all have experienced what happens when a party gets too busy or too noisy - the size of the conversation groups get smaller. If you are having an informal dinner for seven, sometimes the conversation will include the entire table. However while people are eating the conversation will typically devolve into smaller groups: four people at one end of the table will being having one conversation, while the remaining three will be talking at the end other. Sometimes one person will be left out of any conversation, but studies show that with small groups this is less likely to happen. We have a natural tendency not to want to exclude or reject individuals unjustly, so such a singleton will usually find a place in one conversation or another.</p>
<p>Working teams also have this natural tendency to devolve when confronted with external challenges (of which noise is one of the simpler ones) or internal challenges (such as differences of opinion), only reuniting when those challenges are resolved. A team of six can devolve gracefully a number of different ways: a three and a three; a four and a two; or three groups of two. Teams of five can devolve into teams of two and three. A team of four can devolve into two teams of two. In all of these cases the devolution does not exclude any individual&#39;s voice.</p>
<p>However, a triad can not devolve without excluding someone. Triads thus have a lot of subtle pressure to try to keep the group together, so that no individual is explicitly rejected - except for a good reason. This leads to more accountability for the individuals in the group, compared to teams of two where the dyadic nature of the group can override liability.</p>
<h2><a id="voting" name="voting"></a>Unconscious Voting</h2>
<p>A dyad&#39;s inability to vote was an advantage of that group size, and thus issues that require deeper deliberation are often better with dyads. However, you sometimes don&#39;t want as much deliberation. You want fast action.</p>
<p>I find that we unconsciously gauge each others&#39; opinions in a small group very quickly, and even more so with a triad. This means that a triad seems to be able to come to at least some decision very fast. There are many cases where this can be very useful - if that is the intent of your team.</p>
<p>As an personal example, I saw a presentation in the early 1990s from the Apple Human Interface Group (HIG) about their survey of how users colored &quot;folders&quot; on the Macintosh. The result was that there was little commonality - everyone colored folders differently for different reasons. Afterward, I met with the team and suggested that that if they instead asked teams of three to decide how to color code folders that they used together, then the results from all the different teams would have much more commonality. This suggestion ended up getting me a consulting job with Apple HIG, and shows how a triad can quickly create successful performance outcomes.</p>
<p>Triads are not the only group size that can vote easily - all odd size groups can - but I believe the voting of a triad to be fundamentally different because the voting can be so unconscious and informal that the members are not even aware of it. This can be useful, but it can also cause problems.</p>
<p>When I was just starting my business, I was doing a lot of work with a company formed by two partners who had a 50/50 stock split in their company. Theirs was a good partnership; they had very different but complementary skills and worked well and profitably together. As a fellow entrepreneur, I was a peer to both them, and we were developing a new product line together.</p>
<p>However, when I worked with them on this product line, I saw that I&#39;d changed their very successful dyad to a triad, and I thus became a tiebreaker in many of their business decisions - including business decisions on issues that had nothing to do with our joint product. This was caused by a shift in power: one partner might ask me a question about marketing rather than asking his partner (who knew marketing), and then it would become our opinion against the remaining partner&#39;s. Conversely, I found the marketing partner asking me to side with him on development questions.</p>
<p>I found this quite troubling; a more manipulative person could have controlled or broken that relationship by always breaking the ties in their own favor. In our case, we never shipped the product line and went our separate ways. I couldn&#39;t help but think it might have been because my unofficial &quot;vote&quot; was causing problems in their partnership.</p>
<p>When getting a result is the purpose of a team, a triad is better than a dyad as it allows for this voting to take place. As I mentioned to BGIedu, a triad can have a two-to-one vote, allowing a better chance at task accomplishment. Task accomplishment is also achieved because triads stay on topic better than dyads due of this voting ratio: if one member of a dyad decides to go off topic, it is easy for the other to follow his or her lead. In a a triad, two out of the three members would need to &#39;agree&#39; to follow an unrelated discussion.</p>
<h2><a id="elemental_diversity" name="elemental_diversity"></a>Elemental Diversity</h2>
<p>One final advantage of triads when compared to dyads is that the knowledge base of the group is larger. I saw this issue clearly in my recent Social Web for Social Change class at BGIedu, where I changed the team size from two to three, and immediately saw a growth in elemental diversity that benefited the groups.</p>
<p>In this class, I have the students participate in an exercise on personal branding. I originally had the students pair up in teams of two, effectively giving each student a &#39;branding buddy&#39; to help them form their personal brand and to give and receive feedback. In the last year, however, I decided to change this dyad to a triad.</p>
<p>At first, these groups followed the same methods I used for dyads: one person would self-brand themselves to a second person in the group, who would then echo back what they thought they heard the first person say, using their own words. However, it is difficult for two people to really hear the similarities and differences between what they said and what they heard. The third person thus became a neutral sounding board who told both individuals that spoke what they said. Together, all three could figure out the similarities and differences between the statements. After consensus is reached, all three students switch roles. I call this the Echo Exercise, and it shows how triads can be beneficial at times when the natural characteristics of dyads don&#39;t lead to optimum results.</p>
<h1><a id="finalnotes" name="finalnotes"></a>Final Notes</h1>
<p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg" style="float: right;"><img alt="Tripal Spiral —&#0160;from Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain" border="0" height="150" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Triple-Spiral-Symbol-filled.svg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" width="160" /></a>As it happens, this article was created by a triad. It wasn&#39;t purposeful, nor was it meant to show off the findings of this article. Instead, the triad evolved naturally because it proved the best group size for writing this piece.</p>
<p>I came up with the initial concept for the article and wrote out the problem and introduction. Elyn then did considerable research and wrote up a rough draft of her findings. To that point, we were a committed dyad, working together in an organic way. However, we also had an article that felt like it was in two parts. That&#39;s when I had Shannon join us. He reorganized the article, unified its voice, and produced a final draft.</p>
<p>Though it wasn&#39;t purposeful, you can see the advantages of triads just from this example. Most notably, our triad made great use of elemental diversity. Though I held the core ideas and concepts for the article, Elyn provided the research expertise and Shannon provided the editorial expertise that were required to complete it. Voting also came into the equation (in the unconscious way that it tends to in triads) when Shannon effectively &quot;broke the tie&quot; of two different writing styles.</p>
<p>Since then, this triad has fallen apart. It&#39;s something that was created for a specific project and with all of our other tasks, we didn&#39;t have room for it going forward. Teams breaking apart is natural. Sometimes it happens under normal conditions (as was the case with this triad), and sometimes it happens as a result of unhealthy conditions.</p>
<p>I did not give BGIedu any advice at the time about the termination of a team, although it will eventually come up: some teams will end badly, and members of these groups may leave with an impression that a triad is a bad group size, even though the size did not lead the group to ending in an unhealthy way. Perhaps the groups should be counseled, or perhaps the members should jump right back on the triad horse ... but that&#39;s a topic for another article.</p>
<p>From here, I&#39;d like to open the conversation up to you. Have you had experiences in either dyads or triads that you would like to share? Were you one of the BGIedu students in a Study Buddy triad? Did the experiences match the studies shown here or did you have an experience that differed? We invite your comments.</p>

I just discovered your site, and I'm really enjoying your posts.

I am an Organizational Leadership student through Fort Hays State University, and this is a fascinating topic.

I can definitely see the point of the disadvantage of voting. Dyads are forced to use consensus decision-making, unless the power differential is so wide that unilateral decisions are made by the dyad's autocrat. 

Consensus, of course, can take a little longer, but being the default for the Dyad, it makes disagreements automatically covert into brainstorming sessions to find solutions that satisfy both parties. Often, these solutions will be creative and superior to either original idea.

Triads, by virtue of the odd number, CAN employ democracy to make decisions, but the question is-- SHOULD they? A Triad can still opt to employ consensus. If it chooses democracy, it can speed decisions, but there is no requirement for democracy to govern the Triad's decisions. If they opt for consensus, they can once more engage in creative problem-solving that satisfies all parties.

A consensus-based Triad has all the other advantages of a Triad, without the down-side.

BODY:
<p>These are the initial required readings for the first two weeks of my <a href="http://www.bgi.edu/changing-business/social-web-for-social-change/" target="_self">Using the Social Web for Social Change</a> class (hashtag #SW4SX) that I teach in the <a href="http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/hybrid-mba/" target="_self">MBA in Sustainable Systems</a>&#0160;program at <a href="http://www.bgi.edu" target="_self">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this portion of the class is to&#0160;cover an introduction and overview of the landscape of the Social Web, establish among the students the beginning of a shared language about the medium, and introduce a process toward a collaborative culture that we will use for the rest of the course. Students are also kicking off their Beat blogs on sustainability topics, with the goal of helping them move toward having an authentic online voice.</p>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;Why don&#39;t people just say what they mean? The reason is that conversational partners are not modems downloading information into each other&#39;s brains.

So every sentence has to do two things at once: convey a message and continue to negotiate that relationship.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;The term &#39;social software&#39;, which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush&#39;s ideas about &#39;memex&#39; in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. By examining the many terms used to describe today&#39;s &#39;social software&#39; we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology.&quot;</li>

<li>QUOTE: &quot;Social media has become an integral part of modern society.&#0160;There are general social networks with user bases larger than the population of most countries. There are niche sites for virtually every special interest out there. There are sites to share photos, videos, status updates, sites for meeting new people and sites to connect with old friends. It seems there are social solutions to just about every need. In this article, we’ll review the history and evolution of social media from its humble beginnings to the present day.&quot;</li>

<li>ABSTRACT: &quot;How much information is really being collected about you? How is it being used? And could it fall into the wrong hands?&#0160;To find out, we queried Facebook and interviewed some two dozen others, including security experts, privacy lawyers, app developers, and victims of security and privacy abuse. We dug into private, academic, and government research, as well as Facebook’s labyrinthian policies and controls. And we surveyed 2,002 online households, including 1,340 that are active on Facebook, for our annual State of the Net report. We then projected those data to estimate national totals.&quot;</li>

<li>KEYQUOTE: &quot;It is easy to become unsettled by privacy-eroding aspects of awareness tools. But there is another — quite different — result of all this incessant updating: a culture of people who know much more about themselves. Many of the avid Twitterers, Flickrers and Facebook users I interviewed described an unexpected side-effect of constant self-disclosure. The act of stopping several times a day to observe what you’re feeling or thinking can become, after weeks and weeks, a sort of philosophical act. It’s like the Greek dictum to “know thyself,” or the therapeutic concept of mindfulness. (Indeed, the question that floats eternally at the top of Twitter’s Web site — “What are you doing?” — can come to seem existentially freighted. What are you doing?) Having an audience can make the self-reflection even more acute, since, as my interviewees noted, they’re trying to describe their activities in a way that is not only accurate but also interesting to others: the status update as a literary form.&quot;</li>

BODY:
<p>This fall with be the 4th year, and the 5th time that I&#39;ve taught the class&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu/changing-business/social-web-for-social-change/" style="font-size: 10pt;" target="_self">Using the Social Web for Social Change</a>&#0160;(hashtag #SW4SX) in the&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/hybrid-mba/" style="font-size: 10pt;" target="_self">MBA in Sustainable Systems</a>&#0160;program at&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu" style="font-size: 10pt;" target="_self">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>&#0160;(BGI.edu).</p>
<p>The class itself is an elective, but has become so popular that during this school year I am running the class three times: once this summer, again this fall, and a third time in the spring. This class is unique because it crosses class cohorts; it has also been available to members of the Seattle&#0160;<a href="http://www.bgi.edu/academics/mbas/metro-mba/" target="_self">Metro MBA</a> program; is the most popular class for auditing and alumni participation; and we have even had some faculty and TAs take the course. This means that we get a genuine cross-section of BGI and it has been a real inspiration and positive influence on the broader community and on other classes in the program.</p>
<p>The class itself is delivered in a hybrid (sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning" target="_self">blended</a>) format — that is that we meet face-to-face on&#0160;three different weekends for 6 hours each time over the course of a quarter. Supplementing those sessions, we meet online weekly in a synchronous chat room hosted by <a href="http://www.blackboard.com/platforms/collaborate/overview.aspx" target="_self">Blackboard Collaborate</a>. In addition to being part of a hybrid program, my personal goal is for the class to be a completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip_teaching" target="_self">flipped classroom</a>, i.e. we reserve both face-to-face time AND our synchronous time in Collaborate for exercises, keeping lectures to a minimum. If I find myself lecturing, I try to record it so that in the next version of the course we can move the lecture into the readings.</p>
<p>This year is the first year that all MBA students are required to have iPads in the classroom. For many classes this will be mostly for electronic books, but in my class we will be using them for research, collaboration, social media, social networking and much more.</p>
<p>I have always intended the course content to be publically available, but I have just not had the time to massage it to the quality level that I was satisfied with. This year I have two TAs, whose assistance allows me to devote more time to making some of this material available to the public.</p>

<p>Here is the official syllabus for this fall&#39;s class:</p>
<h2>Using the Social Web for Social Change</h2>
<p><strong>Course Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This course will focus on using the latest social online tools to effect social change. The course will incorporate technical and practical aspects of the social web, as well as critical discussion of the latest theories on how to effectively influence change using social web technologies. &#0160;Students will leave the class being comfortable creating a persuasive social web site or a social video on a sustainability topic, using either computer based or tablet based tools. </p>
<p>The purpose of this course is to acquaint students with the new and helpful tools available to them in the tool chest of open technologies called Web 2.0. Students will receive both a practical and a theoretical grounding in social networking, leading and participating in virtual teams, integrating the web into marketing efforts, and using the web to support social change. Students will use both computers and tablets for the duration of this course and will learn new and helpful tools specific to each device.</p>

BODY:
<p>Over my lifetime I have encountered a number of “tools for ignition” — a phrase which I use to describe innovative products that have empowered people and created movements. On the 25th anniversary of Hypercard’s introduction, I want to take a look back at some of these tools.</p>
<h2>BASIC (1976)</h2>
<p>In 1976 I encountered my first tool for ignition: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates">Bill Gate&#39;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSAI_8080">MicroSoft BASIC</a> running on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSAI_8080">IMSAI 8080</a>. There was no ROM on this computer, so you had to load a boot program using the front panel switches you see above. This program would then allow us to use a paper-tape reader, from which we would load BASIC.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="310px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2hMUDycBGPQ3z3AM1rBtQw5J5-xDS9vNnaBZEbJf0G_GyROnc2pvxi0zCxLwxYH5jc3NTeD0gi3nbCnuq516Qzq4b1mqarsVDLAZaenIW0aPmtN6-JQ" width="540px;" /></p>
<p>At 15 it wasn&#39;t the hardware that got me excited, it was the idea of software — that you could take a creative idea that was in your mind and then craft that idea into a reality.</p>
<p>My passion of the moment was French (the daughter of my French teacher was quite cute), so my first program was an attempt to teach my computer to translate between French to English.</p>
<p>Alas, I utterly failed in my first attempt, limited by the 4K RAM, and I had no more luck working in 8K. But my failure didn&#39;t matter in the long term — it inspired a career creating tools that nurture creative passions.</p>
<h2>BBS (1978)</h2>
<p>My next experience with a tool for ignition was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Christensen">Ward Christensen&#39;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBBS">CBBS</a>, the first electronic bulletin board system. Within months of its release in 1978, there were BBSs sprouting up all over the United States. I dialed a long-distance number, logged into a BBS, and discovered many passionate people wanting to share their experience — not only computer, but life. For the first time, I experienced computer software as a tool for human interaction, not only as a utility for running a program.</p>
<p>By this point I was working after school part-time in a microcomputer store, so I scavenged up an old S100 computer and a used modem and made available a small BBS in my hometown. No longer having to pay long-distance charges, at 17 I found myself at the center of an online community. This experience proved invaluable — indeed, today I credit my success to the skills I acquired in facilitating online conversations and growing communities that share common interests.</p>
<h2>MacPaint (1984)</h2>
<p>Six years passed, and personal computers started to become more common in people’s workplaces and homes. Unlike the IMSAI 8080, they now had screens and keyboards, and they made great text processors and data crunchers, but they weren’t particularly “sexy”. On January 24, 1984, the first Mac was released, and I dropped into my local computer store to see what it was all about. The original 128K Mac was “different”, as Apple’s later marketing campaign put it, but also clunky in appearance.</p>
<p>However, my jaw dropped when I saw Bill Atkinson&#39;s (MacPaint) [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint</a>]. The simple elegance of this software that allowed me to draw and express myself graphically on a computer screen with a mouse was what sold me on the Mac, not the hardware.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="375px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fg9RtUixZeDKNeftTruklS0XPfhlwgQigeysrEooKC06H8mD4BYUFr16CvUtnCTGV5XGPv2zr_I5GPiOSV9uvM3riaLE6DvDTWTdRC1wHZ20Ag-BEvw" width="500px;" /></p>
<p>By this point, I was making my living doing software development. I wasn&#39;t an artist myself, but I dropped everything to hire some artist friends to start drawing on the Mac. I would start a clip-art company, I thought, not knowing that too many other people had the same idea. So I considered how I could build on my prior experience with computers and take advantage of this new platform. I wrote a bootstrap app (in BASIC!) to take advantage of the Mac’s serial port and enable the user to download a more serious terminal app. Later I published the first Macintosh BBS Mouse Exchange BBS, and the first graphical interface to a BBS.</p>
<h2>Open Standards (1985)</h2>
<p>Later in 1985 I experienced my next tool for ignition — though “tool” may seem an odd term to describe something so abstract — open standards. I had recently parlayed my facilitation skills into a paid position as a CompuServe sysop, and because of my bootstrap app, the Mac BBS that I published, I participated in my first open standard, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBinary">MacBinary</a>, a way of encoding early Mac applications so that they could be transferred online.</p>
<p>This was my first experience working with other engineers to facilitate the creation of something quite ephemeral and hard to describe to non-programmers. Not quite software, but a language between software, enabling them to share information and work together despite being written by different people in different programming languages.</p>
<p>In the open standards community I learned the value of some principles that I use daily: &quot;Ship early and often&quot;, &quot;Fail fast&quot;, &quot;Perfection is the enemy of the good&quot;, &quot;Be conservative in what you send, liberal in what you accept&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>My experience with MacBinary motivated me to continue participating in open standards efforts over the years, leading to what I consider my biggest success as a facilitator and co-author of the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt">SSL Standard</a>, the world&#39;s most widely deployed security standard. What drew me to SSL (as opposed to competitive security standards offered by others) was that it could be used for much more than just internet transactions. It could be used to secure a variety of conversations between people. Using the power of the RFC editor, I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">reserved ports</a> for secure SMTP, IMAP, POP, IRC, FTP and more. I got some flack for this as internet ports are considered a limited resource, but it turned out well when SSL and these ports were used twenty years later during the Arab Spring to help ensure freedom of communication between protesters.</p>
<h2>HyperCard (1987)</h2>
<p>Twenty-five years ago this month — August 11,1987 at MacWorld — I encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson&#39;s</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">Hypercard</a>. Hard to describe but truly a tool for ignition if there ever was one, Hypercard has been variously called a &quot;stack of virtual cards, &quot;hypermedia system&quot;, &quot;programming for the masses&quot;. Bill Atkinson described it as &quot;a construction kit that lets normal people make their own software&quot;.</p>
<p>I was already programming in a variety of programming languages, but like MacPaint before it, HyperCard drew me in because of its elegance and its ability to allow non-programmers to participate in the creation of software. You can see the most complex HyperCard stack I ever wrote, running a TV studio at Apple Computer, in the first 40 seconds of this <a href="http://archive.org/details/hypercard_2">1990 video feature</a> on HyperCard.</p>
<p>HyperCard empowered a whole generation of passionate, creative people who otherwise never would have had the chance to share their ideas and visions with the world. I saw thinkers I admired begin to express their thoughts through software. Artists and designers loved that they could bring their language of imagery to life. Children who never had programmed before would start by drawing on some &quot;cards&quot;, add buttons, show their friends, get excited and ultimately start on the path to learn how to express oneself through software. Amazing stories were told: some of my favorites were &quot;If Monks Had Macs&quot;, &quot;Spaceship Warlock&quot;, &quot;Beyond Cyperpunk&quot; and ultimately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="417px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6llXEJWlkTXTnx1w9A4-QrDaHAtLqsFlGBUSo1ZyzEcLcUgSQGTvDRzbPkywmya5xmwfLzYhSumo9ZJOChJObJD-piKzx8byUQbkTmjw4P29ixJ17Q4" width="576px;" /></p>
<p>HyperCard had a profound impact beyond those who discovered and used it on the Mac. Many do not know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, the creator of the World Wide Web, was <a href="http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html">inspired</a> by HyperCard. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham">Ward Cunningham</a>, investor of the first Wiki also <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiHyperCard">credits</a> it for inspiration.</p>
<h2>HyperCard&#39;s 25th Anniversary</h2>
<p>In celebration of Hypercard&#39;s 25th anniversary, we asked Bill Atkinson to come to the Hillside Club in Berkeley to <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/hillsideclub.org/hillsideclub/programs/cybersalons">speak</a>. In advance of this, I asked my colleagues and friends to share what inspired them about HyperCard by posting to blogs and twitter using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23hypercard25th">#HyperCard25th</a>. Here are some of my favorite appreciations:</p>

<p>Alex Seville ‏@alex_seville Coming up with ideas, and easily implementing them with Hypercard certainly influenced my lifelong interest in programming</p>
<p>Jason McIntosh ‏@JmacDotOrg I used Hypercard while employed at UMaine to make interactive presentations for students &amp; faculty. My first programming job.</p>
<p>Kristee Rosendahl ‏@SmartGardener1 HyperCard had seismic impact on how we envisioned/designed &quot;multimedia&quot; at the Apple Multimedia Lab back in those early days.</p>
<p>Bryan Stearns ‏@bryanstearns Standing on the shoulders of giants… like you do</p>
<p>Clark Quinn ‏@Quinnovator HyperCard played big part in my work and thinking: learning games and performance support tools</p>
<p>Scott Draves ‏@spot Blew my mind and absorbed many hours, yes we had it back in the 80s. Now remember the man who made it</p>

<h2>Infinite Canvas (2012)</h2>
<p>It is the mindset expressed in three more&#0160;quotes from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23hypercard25th">#HyperCard25th</a> neatly sum up what inspired me to create a new tool for ignition — <a href="http://www.infinitecanvasapp.com/">Infinite Canvas</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mike Sugarbaker ‏@misuba It&#39;s HyperCard&#39;s 25th birthday. We still haven&#39;t seen its equal as far as I&#39;m concerned. I hope we do.</p>
<p>David HM Spector ‏@dhmspector HyperCard let me do fast prototypes &amp; lots of flexible mini-apps for my clients; great tool! So Apple, HC for iPad? Please?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Since 2007 I have been running a participatory event, originally called iPhoneDevCamp, but now called <a href="http://www.iosdevcamp.org/">iOSDevCamp</a>. Over the course of a weekend we get ~400-500 people to stay up late and show their effort in a Hackathon. At the <a href="http://www.iosdevcamp.org/2012/07/23/ios-devcamp-2012-awards/">last one</a> 71 new iPhone and iPad apps were created in 36 hours, 29 of which were <a href="http://www.iosdevcamp.org/2012/07/26/open-source-apps-at-iosdevcamp-2012/">open source</a>.</p>
<p>iOSDevCamp appeals to me because it is creative ignition in action — it was founded on twitter, organized as an online community, supports the ideals of collaboration and nutures passionate creative people. In recent years I&#39;ve been quite proud of the diversity of the conference, with <a href="http://www.xeodesign.com/tiltstory.html">designers</a>, <a href="http://ipadportraits.blogspot.com/2012/07/ipad-portrait-of-paul-ossenbruggen.html">artists</a>, <a href="http://ebayinkblog.com/2012/08/08/girls-ideas-take-center-stage-at-iosdevcamp/">women</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYooh4UU_H0&amp;feature=plcp">young adults</a> and even <a href="http://www.iosdevcamp.org/2012/08/04/qa-with-krithika-yetchina-winner-of-best-woman-entrepreneur/">children</a> participating.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="266px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/L3ESdmV0HCk-468UAzVPlU_rVBCl5trMN1TARxQNrmyhMf5hB-YkzxvPCpLr08BEUt9oYdBXclqFP5yjh9WfQHOforcIM2PTkQC3fA7J1E7pFN51oEU" width="400px;" /></p>
<p>However, today the barriers between being a spectator and becoming a creator are huge. It is increasingly hard for a new user to create a good-looking web page. The skills required to create an iPhone or iPad app are quite intimidating. I have had many designers show up at iOSDevCamp whom I was unable to match with a coder because they lacked the most basic understanding of the principles of interactivity. Sadly, I was unable to facilitate their full participation.</p>
<p>So at iOSDevCamp 2010 I started <a href="http://www.infinitecanvasapp.com/">Infinite Canvas</a>, based on the principles of what inspired me about HyperCard. This tool needed to allow artists, designers, photographers, children to easily experience creating interactive stories and experiences. It needed to not only be easy to use, but also easy to share — no gatekeepers saying &quot;This isn&#39;t good enough&quot;. It needed to support discoverability, where those new to the language of interactivity could learn and advance their skills to ultimately create quite sophisticated experiences. And it needed to take advantage of the new computing experiences that the iPad offers — portability, touchability — advantages that even the lightest laptop was never quite able to match.<img align="right" alt="" height="160px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-R0dPu8LFfhE45XG327JNH1ZlNRqH_Z3kRftvNsLCIRIPUM3HMyboMtNiBSqyrd_qvtOiDq6DTQnZKricdwNvzjN9Labtk7iIF8fSIbVGl4KT_HQFwI" width="120px;" /></p>
<p>The first version of <a href="http://bit.ly/infinitecanvasapp">Infinite Canvas</a> iPad app, initially a viewer-only version, was approved and <a href="http://www.infinitecanvasapp.com/2012/08/11/announcing-the-release-of-infinite-canvas-viewer-in-the-app-store/">released</a> Friday in the Apple App Store, the day before HyperCard&#39;s anniversary. There is a library of example canvases available which can be downloaded for free using the app. Users will be able to create their own canvases in the near future when the Infinite Canvas authoring tool makes its debut.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go to offer all that HyperCard offered. We support both simple tiles and HTML5 tiles, but the learning bridge between them is huge. But in the spirit of &quot;Ship early and often&quot;, &quot;fail fast&quot;, and &quot;perfection is the enemy of the good&quot; we wanted to make this tool available now.</p>
<p>Bill Atkinson once <a href="http://archive.org/details/hypercard_2">explained what motivated him to create HyperCard:</a> &quot;A lot of people are going to get opened up, enabled, empowered to control their computer. That&#39;s really what we&#39;re trying to do.” And that is exactly what we are trying to do on the iPad with Infinite Canvas.</p>

Even when working for large organizations I find my approach to be entrepreneurial (what my mentor&#0160;<a href="http://www.pinchot.com/">Gifford Pinchot </a>would call&#0160;<a href="http://www.intrapreneur.com/MainPages/History.html">Intrapreneurial</a>).</p>
<p>It took me a while to accept that being an entrepreneur is part of my fundamental nature. It wasn&#39;t until my father retold me some stories about my childhood that the appellation truly clicked for me as being true. He would point out the treehouse in the woods that I organized, the sci-fi fanzine that I published, the software I wrote for a psychologist at age 16, and many other stories.</p>
<p>My father he would tell me that he sometimes feared that I would be beat up by my peers in childhood because of this tendency. I was always the one who would discover the game that we should play together, the one that would suggest new ideas—but I didn&#39;t have the typical talents that children expect of their leaders. I was average looking, not charismatic, not strong nor quick and I not part of the &quot;in crowd&quot;. However, I muddled through my form of childhood leadership with the minimum of peer trouble.</p>
<p>I have discovered that I am different then many other lifetime entrepreneurs.Unlike them, I never sold lemonade on the curbside—I am not a natural salesman.&#0160;I never led a sports team.&#0160;I never bought candy cheaply at the market and sold it for a higher price at school. Instead, for me entrepreneuring was about discovering and sharing a passion with friends and doing something with it — a less self-serving variant of Tom Sawyer&#39;s inspirational &quot;Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?” pitch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zenlight/5603317504/" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-top: 1em;" title="Yahoo Employee Volunteers by AlexPears, on Flickr"><img alt="Yahoo Employee Volunteers" height="160" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5603317504_d8e7f754c2_m.jpg" width="240" /></a>This means that what I do best is bring people together with a common passion to create things. All of the successes of my career have had that as a fundamental element of what I do.</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>This gives me a somewhat different view of the nature of work — I have to have a relationship with those that work with me, I have to hold a space for the passions of everyone involved, and I have to marshal the creative best of everyone. This has made me an unusual leader and manager.</p>
<p>In recent years I have been teaching part-time in the sustainable MBA program at <a href="http://www.bgi.edu/">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>. Even there I take an entrepreneurial approach, and teach my students in my own unique entrepreneurial style.</p>
<p>In last year&#39;s class one of my students, Bria Schlottman, sent me a Twitter DM: <em>&quot;Could you do me a quick favor: in a brainstorm type of dump, what words come to mind when you think about &#39;work&#39;? Please list as many single words as possible.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I replied: <em>&quot;flow, shared energy, companionship, natural light, fresh air, a bit noisy, good connectivity, shared lunches&quot;</em></p>
<p>With this and many other responses from her social network she created a video, and her first post for this blog asking the question&#0160;<a href="http://www.refreshingwork.com/2010/10/what-is-work.html">What is Work?</a></p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-8cnEs5Hk-Q" width="420"></iframe></p>
<p>Even though the blog and video were assignments for my class, when the course was complete Bria and I continued to have a dialogue about the nature of work.</p>
<p>We each come from different perspective, but we both agree that our society&#39;s relationship to work can and should improve. We both have some insights as to what that would require, but neither of us have the answers. Now that Bria has graduated and found gainful employment with her newly-minted MBA, she has the time and energy to take this topic forward, as do I. We believe that by collaborating together in this blog that we can inspire each other to dive deeper into this interesting topic.</p>
<p>Thus Bria and I invite you to show your insights with us and participate in whitewashing this fence, aka &quot;Refreshing Work&quot;.</p>

BODY:
<p><a href="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/faq.htm" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" title="Taylor FAQ"><img alt="Matt Taylor Photo" border="0" height="200" src="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/graphics_7/350_matt_2003_f.jpg" width="149" /></a> In the late 80&#39;s I met <a href="http://www.matttaylor.com/">Matt Taylor</a> at a Mac user group event, and we became friends. We eventually became reciprocal apprentices — he learned from me about computers and collaborating online, and I learned from him about facilitating face-to-face collaboration and the architecture of facilitation.</p>
<p>Matt comes from an unusual background — he studied architecture with <a href="http://www.franklloydwright.org/web/Home.html">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> during the master architect&#39;s latter years at <a href="http://www.franklloydwright.org/web/Tours.html">Taliesin West</a>. During that period of Wright&#39;s life he was thinking big. He was considering projects like bridges so wide that they could have a city park in the middle of them and he was reassessing the nature of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadacre_City">city</a>.</p>
<p>Matt discovered that a key challenge to implementing these visionary architectures was facilitating a large group of people so that he could gather the different skills required, such as architecture, construction, finance, and political savvy. As an architect, his initial approach to the problem of group genius was to design <a href="http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/fall97/taylors_own_navcenter.htm">furniture</a> and <a href="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/papers/taylor_environments_tour.htm">spaces</a> for collaboration. However, as his practice grew he also found himself in a &quot;thirty-year sidetrack&quot; of becoming a master facilitator and teaching others to be able to do the same. His organization MG Taylor grew and together they created a number of <a href="http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/jotm/summer97/designshop_whatis.htm">practices</a> and <a href="http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/glasbead/expmodel.htm">models</a> for collaboration, and even a &quot;System for a Knowledge Economy&quot;&#0160;<a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6292830.html">patent</a>.</p>
<p>There is one particular motto that he said to me back then that has stuck with me. It is not one of his great <a href="http://www.mgtaylor.com/mgtaylor/glasbead/axioms.htm">axioms</a>, but a simple statement from an architect and system designer at heart:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: large;">&quot;Manage the Environment, not the People.&quot;</span></em></p>
<p>I adopted this philosophy and this has been a core axiom of my management philosophy for over 20 years now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/graphics2/sittingarea_cubeoffice_hs.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/graphics2/sittingarea_cubeoffice_hs.jpg" /></a> At its simplest level it means that I care deeply about the space that I and the others employed by me work in. This includes such things as natural light &amp; air, plants, low-VOC paint and carpet, ergonomic furniture and tools. For instance&#0160;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980709005818/http://www.consensus.com/">Consensus Development</a>, my biggest success, the team had all of this in our work space as well as over 5 linear feet of white wall <strong>per person</strong>. Thinking about the environment of the work space does not have to be limited to the physical — I design virtual spaces with the same intent as I do the physical.</p>
<p>At a deeper level it means that my job as a manager is to discover what is required for people to be effective and successful, and create an environment and a system for them to be able to do so. This has a secondary result — we don&#39;t blame the individuals when something goes wrong. Often, the true source of the failure is our environment and its core systems (possibly including our hiring system). Yes, sometimes this still did mean we had to let people go, but we didn&#39;t need to personalize it and blame individuals.</p>
<p>At the deepest level it means that looking at the big picture and searching for environmental and systemic issues. As an entrepreneur I recognized early on that online trust was a key system problem that needed to be solved, and knowing this helped me be in right place to make SSL the largest deployed <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt">security standard</a> in the world.</p>
<p>Even now as I am increasingly involved in teaching in the green MBA program at Bainbridge Graduate Institute (BGI), I find that my success as an educator is largely due to the same approach. I try to create an environment for learning first — the students will motivate themselves to success through experience and a supportive environment of peers, rather then through rote instruction.</p>
<p>In writing this blog post, I wrote Matt to ask about the origin of this axiom, and this is what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;It was Bucky Fuller who said &#39;do not try to change people, change the environment which they are in.&#39; In saying this he meant the physical environment and much more than just that. This had a great impact on my thinking circa the mid 70s.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Frank Lloyd Wright stressed designing environments which sheltered, facilitated and expressed a &quot;way of life.&quot; This was brought home to me by my interactions with many of his clients especially <a href="http://www.matttaylor.com/public/PostUsonian.htm#pew_story">Mrs. Pew</a>.</em></p>
<em> </em>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><em>The idea that an environment, itself can have a transformative effect on someone totally changed my concept of architecture from that as a visual art (which is just technique) to an experiential art which embeds a philosophy of living.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as I continue exploration of the nature of work, I offer Buckminster Fuller &amp; Matt Taylor&#39;s thoughts on managing an environment as one of many clues toward a solution to a &quot;way of work&quot;. I&#39;ll share more details on how this philosophy has worked for me in upcoming blog posts, but in the meantime I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts, and any questions that you have about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563798/" title="Trust Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Trust Circle" height="160" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3055563798_5355b9b99c_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>With Google+ almost two weeks into its test phase, conversation about this new social network service seems to be going in circles.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>That’s because Circles is the Google+ feature that users are generating the most buzz about. It’s Google’s answer to the problem of organizing your social graph online.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph">social graph</a> it’s a map of everyone you know and how they are related to you. Social graphs are tricky; as you try to define them you’ll inevitably run into some complications.</p>
<p>Pete Pachal, news director of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387808,00.asp">@PCMag</a> comments:</p>
<blockquote><em>“People want things easy, and Google Circles isn’t easy. It puts the burden on users to take the time to think about each and every contact and put them in a specific bucket. To use the feature effectively, users will certainly have to create new Circles, and that requires even more thought. After using Google+ for a few minutes last night, I was often unsure which Circles to put certain people in and, more to the point, which to leave them out of. And what if you create a new Circle that should include some of the people in other Circles you already have?”</em></blockquote>
<p>Circles are lists that you’ve created by grouping people together and giving them a name. They’re important in Google+ because when you post you must explicitly say which “Circles” you wish to share with. Posting to a limited list of people is a big change from existing social networks such as Facebook, where posts are sent to all mutual friends by default, or Twitter, where posts are public. This change forces you to think more deeply about your social graph and who should see each item you post.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BwvygI2xKGM" width="560"></iframe></p>
<h2 id="yourinitialsetofcircles">Your Initial Set of Circles</h2>
<p>Google+ will present you with 4 suggested set of Circles: Friends, Family, Acquaintances, and Following.</p>
<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Default-google+-circles" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d image-full" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef014e89d8ca03970d-800wi" title="Default-google+-circles" /></a> <br />Google+ also defines five special Circles: Two are only for reading: &quot;Stream&quot; which is everyone in any of your Circles; and &quot;Incoming&quot; which is are posts that are shared to you by people not in your Circles. Then are three special Circles managed by Google only for posting: &quot;Your Circles&quot; which is everyone in any of your Circles; “Extended” which is everyone in your Circles plus the people in <em>their</em> Circles; and “Public” which is <em>anyone</em>.</p>
<p>Few find this default set to be sufficient. As a result, most Google+ users are soon creating new Circles, moving people around, renaming Circles, etc.</p>
<p>There are sound reasons for people finding the default Circles limiting. Sociological research shows that everyone has a number of concentric personal circles (see my blog post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">Community by the Numbers, Part II: Personal Circles</a> for more details). These circles are sometimes called “ego-centric” social graphs as the individual is located in the center. This sort of graph is the model I used when I began reorganizing my own Google+ Circles.</p>
<p>I started out using Support (for my Support Circle), Close (for my Sympathy Circle), Trusted (for my Trust Circle), and Colleagues (for my Emotional Circle), but that didn’t work for very long. I’ve since been experimenting with a number of different ways to organize my Circles. I wanted an initial set that would offer useful early advice for using Google+ but would still be applicable for when expanded to hundreds of people. (I now have over 600 people in my Circles.)</p>
<p>One insight I’ve had is to avoid the word ‘friends’, which has been corrupted to almost meaninglessness in recent years. So instead I use terminology like Peers for my trust circle and Kith for the combination of my support and sympathy circles. (Kith may be familiar to you from the phrase “kith and kin”. The root of kith means “to know”, thus it’s those people that you know very well and that know you very well.)</p>
<p>I also learned that sub-Circles exist within Circles. Using a ‘general ledger’ system of naming Circles with numbers—which I’ll demonstrate in a moment—helps me keep these Circles and sub-Circles in order and allows me to easily add new Circles when I need to. Hopefully Google+ will in the future introduce features that allow us to order Circles as we please, but until then this numbering system works.</p>
<p>Working with Google+ has also shown me that some Circles are for reading and other Circles are for posting. I’ll talk a little more about this below.</p>
<p>It has only been a week, but by combining these insights to organize my Circles I’ve improved my ease of use and become better able to manage my time while using Google+.</p>
<p>Here is my recommended initial list of Circles:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>0.0 ME</strong> - a simple Circle with just yourself in it, for saving posts, for drafts, etc.<br /><strong>1.0 KIN</strong> - your family &amp; extended family<br /> <strong> 2.0 KITH</strong> - your best friends, your confidants (i.e. those with whom one shares a secret or private matter, trusting them not to repeat it to others)<br /><strong> 3.0 PEERS</strong> - your trusted colleagues, those who you work closely with, your collaborators<br /><strong> 4.0 LOCAL</strong> - your neighbors, parents of your children&#39;s friends, people you&#39;d invite to a party<br /><strong> 5.0</strong> {various groups &amp; interests}<br /><strong> 6.0 ACQUAINTANCES</strong> - people you know, but that you don&#39;t know well or that don’t know you well<br /><strong> 7.0 FOLLOWS ME</strong> - people who follow you on Google+, who you may or may not know<br /><strong> 8.0 WATCHING</strong> - people whose posts you read, but who don&#39;t necessarily read your posts<br /><strong> 9.0 SPECIAL</strong> - useful for special lists &amp; exceptions</p>
<h2 id="expandingcircles">Expanding Circles</h2>
<p>Many people will find my default set of ~10 Circles to be very useful, and need only add a few more. However, the design of this set is to allow for much greater expansion should you need it.</p>
<p>Like those “personal circles” that I wrote about previously, most of the Circles above are ego-centric: they’re fundamentally centered on your own personal social graph. This isn’t the only potential type of Circle, however. Socio-centric Circles aren’t centered on you, though they still have some sort of membership boundaries, while info-centric Circles are based on topics instead of being based on relationships. These socio-centric and info-centric Circles will support many relationships better than ego-centric Circles do.</p>
<p>If someone seems to write a lot about a particular topic, I put him or her into an appropriate info-centric Circle. My own info-centric Circles thus include people who post about topics like iOS Development, the Social Web, Sustainability/Green, and Entrepreneuring. If a number of people are all part of a group or all come from a certain geographical area then I put them together in a socio-centric circle. After creating the Circles, I put the ones that were geographic into 4.0 of my ledger, then placed the others in 5.0. (I tried separating out groups and interests, and found that didn’t work, so now I keep them together.)</p>
<p>I now have over 600 people in my Google Plus+ social graph. All together my Circles now look something like this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>0.0 Read Later<br /> 0.1 Drafts<br /> 0.2 Book Project<br /> 0.3 iPad Project<br /><br /> 1.0 ALL KIN<br /> 1.1 Immediate Family<br /> 1.2 Extended Family<br /><br /> 2.0 ALL KITH<br /> 2.1 Close Friends<br /> 2.2 Old But Distant Friends<br /> 2.3 Distant Family<br /><br /> 3.0 ALL PEERS<br /> 3.2 Collaborators<br /> 3.3 Current Professional Colleagues<br /> 3.4 Former Professional Colleagues<br /><br /> 4.0 ALL LOCAL<br /> 4.1 Local Kith, Kin &amp; Peers<br /> 4.2 Local Berkeley<br /> 4.3 Non-Local Seattle<br /> 4.3 Non-Local Portland<br /><br /> 5.0 ALL GROUPS &amp; INTERESTS<br /> 5.1 Entrepreneurs<br /> 5.2 Apple &amp; iOS<br /> 5.3 - iOSDevCamp<br /> 5.4 Green &amp; Sustainability<br /> 5.5 - BGIedu<br /> 5.6 Social Web<br /> 5.7 - Jerry’s Kids<br /><br /> 6.0 ACQUAINTANCES<br /> 6.1 Familiar Strangers<br /> 6.2 Friendly Strangers<br /><br /> 7.0 FOLLOWS ME<br /> 7.1 Core Audience<br /> 7.2 Commented or Shared My Posts<br /><br /> 8.0 WATCHING<br /> 8.2 Pundits<br /> 8.3 Celebrities<br /> 8.4 Noisy<br /><br /> 9.0 ALL<br /> 9.1 Everyone But Pundits, Celebrities &amp; Noisy<br /> 9.2 Read Daily<br /> 9.3 Read Weekly</strong></p>
<p>In a future blog post I’ll share my ongoing experience with using this approach to Circles, but this example shows how easy it is to separate and add Circles as your interests change and grow.</p>
<h1 id="managingyourcircles">Managing Your Circles</h1>
<p>We, as humans, enjoy social networks in large part because we get to interact with people. Managing your Circles is thus about more than just understanding your social graph. It also allows you to manage your time effectively when you read and share with other people on Google+. Here is my approach for how to manage the time you spend reading, sharing, and managing your social graph.</p>
<h3 id="circlesforreading"><strong>Circles for Reading</strong></h3>
<p>I find it useful to think about Circles that are explicitly for reading as different from Circles intended for sharing. I have a few of these read-only Circles. Thus, my “Pundits” Circle contains people that share a lot and for whom I don’t always want to read everything. My “Read Daily” Circle is conversely for people for whom I want to read everything they post.</p>
<p>I’ve also found Circles helpful for close collaborators. It’s easy in Google+ to have a conversation with someone directly by simply typing their name as +&lt;name&gt; into the share field of posts. However, I find these direct posts get lost over time. To resolve this problem, create a Circle dedicated to just the two of you: a dyad. I have a number of people that I’m collaborating with closely and I use these small Circles to both keep track of our mutual posts and to see what they are thinking about at the moment. Examples of this kind of two-person Circle include my “Book Project” and “iPad Project”</p>
<h3 id="timemanagementofreadingcircles"><strong>Time Management of Reading Circles</strong></h3>
<p>Each day I look first at my “ALL KIN”, “ALL KITH” and and “ALL PEER” Circles to see what is going on with my support, sympathy and trust cliques. Then I’ll read my “Read Daily” Circles.</p>
<p>After reading these daily basics (which I try to keep to a limited number), I’ll typically pick an interest, a geography, or a group, depending on what I’m doing that day. (My personal time-management style is to only follow one interest per day, e.g. if I am working on my iPad app then I’m not reading Social Web posts.) If I’m preparing a blog post and want to see what my audience is thinking I might review “Core Audience”, or “FOLLOWS ME”. If I’m traveling I might read one of my non-local Circles such as “Seattle”. If I’m doing ‘weak-signal research’ I might start with “ALL INTERESTS”, but if I’m particularly tolerant of noise I might read “Familiar Strangers”, “FOLLOWS ME”, “Everyone but Pundits &amp; Strangers”, “Pundits”, or even “ALL”.</p>
<h2 id="postingtocircles">Posting to Circles</h2>
<p>One of the important reasons for creating Circles in the first place is so that you can share with groups of people. I’ve developed some strategies for this as well.</p>
<h3 id="circlesforposting:"><strong>Circles for Posting</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve found it useful to create a Circle that only contains yourself. I have two of these — “Read Later”, and “Drafts”. If I’m reading and I see something interesting but don’t have time for it immediately, I’ll share it with my “Read Later” Circle so that I can quickly go back to it. Similarly, if I need to do some more research before writing and sharing, I’ll share my immediate thoughts in “Drafts”. As new features are added to Google+ these Circles will hopefully become obsolete, but they are useful for now.</p>
<h3 id="managingsharingprivacyofprivateposts"><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Private Posts</strong></h3>
<p>When sharing, you want to ask yourself if this is ‘private’ post, a ‘quasi-public’ post or a ‘public’ post.</p>
<p>My private posts tend to go “KIN”, “KITH”, a dyad project, or one of the sub-Circles of PEER depending on their context. Some posts that are of only geographic interest (say a party, or local event) will be shared privately to the appropriate local Circle. If you are using my ledger system of using numbers in Circle names, these are the lower numbers—5.0 and below are Circles where I’m more sensitive about privacy.</p>
<p>Once shared, these more personal posts will be labeled as “Limited” instead of using the “Public” label that allows anyone to see them. If a recipient tries to share a “Limited” post, a box will pop up reminding the person: “This post was originally shared with a limited audience – remember to be thoughtful about who you share it with”. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, one purpose of Circles on Google+ is to determine who gets what information.</p>
<p>Though it may be easy to create Circles to segregate those with whom you wish to share private information, the recipients of your posts have no such limitations and could share outward beyond your intent (though they will be warned if they try to, as noted above). To enable further privacy you can disable resharing of these personal posts made to your Circles. To do so, share your post to a non-public Circle, then you select the arrow in the upper-right-hand corner where you can edit, delete or disable the post, and click on the final option, “Disable Reshare”.</p>
<p>There’s another privacy issue: by clicking the grey “Limited” label, a message’s recipient can see all others you shared the post with. This could potentially result in privacy problems, as the reader could discover who is in one of your Circles. There are ways of eliminating this by going into your Privacy account settings, which I will cover in a future post.</p>
<h3 id="managingsharingprivacyofquasi-publicposts"><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Quasi-Public Posts</strong></h3>
<p>I call posts “quasi-public” when they’re of narrow interest to a specific group or a topic that isn’t really relevant to other members of my audience. I find these quasi-public posts happen the most for my more esoteric interests—for instance, when I’m sharing a complex iPhone development article that is really only interesting to a narrow group of my contacts.</p>
<p>In Google Reader, I typically wouldn’t share these articles at all because there were so many of my contacts that wouldn’t be interested in them and it would only be noise to them. Ditto with Twitter. I found that sometimes people would stop following me after a conference I attended because I posted regularly and the conference was not of interest to them. This could be quite frustrating at times. Though these posts were not private by any means, I only wanted to share them with a specific group, such as an iPhone group. Now with Circles, I can share this information easily with my “Apple &amp; iOS” Circle. I find that this feature is what makes Google+’s Circles so potentially powerful.</p>
<p>Though I might offer much of this more esoteric information as “quasi-public” posts to a specific group or interest, I’ll probably offer the best of them to the “Public”. Sometimes that is what it means to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven">Maven</a>—you share across social network boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="managingsharingprivacyofpublicposts"><strong>Managing Sharing Privacy of Public Posts</strong></h3>
<p>Sharing a post to your “Your Circles” is effectively public, as is sharing to “Extended Circles”. Ask yourself if there is really some reason why you don’t want to make a post totally “Public” so that it is searchable by those who are not members of Google+. If there is some reason, consider sharing to your “ALL” Circle or some other more limited circle instead, as you’ll have more control and can turn off resharing or commenting.</p>
<h2 id="managingyoursocialgraph">Managing Your Social Graph</h2>
<p>Maintaining your Circles can take away from the time you can spend on reading and sharing. I’ve come up with the following strategy to limit the time I spend.</p>
<p>To start with, I have some basic rules for which Circles to place people in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I’m notified that someone is following me, I add them to “FOLLOWS ME” and an appropriate other Circle. If I vaguely recognize a follower’s name or face, I put them in “Familiar Strangers”. If I don’t recognize them at all but they look interesting, I add them to “Friendly Strangers”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I’m notified that someone has +1’ed, commented, or mentioned me in a post, I add them to “Core Audience” and the appropriate sub-Circle. I will also make sure that the other Circles they are in are correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I discover while I’m reading that someone is too noisy for the Circle I selected, I’ll move them to a more appropriate Circle—or place them in the “Noisy” Circle or even block them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timemanagementofyoursocialgraph"><strong>Time Management of Your Social Graph</strong></h3>
<p>In addition I review a few of my Circles every day. I do so by going to “Manage Circles”, then selecting “People in your Circles” and sorting by last name. I choose that letter of the alphabet that corresponds to the day of the month and hover my mouse over each name. (For example, I look at names starting with “L” on July 12th, as “L” is the 12th letter.) Google+ highlights the Circles that each person is in. If they’re in the wrong Circle, I move them. I might even click on some people and review their profile so that I can see who they are—or (if I already know them) see what they are up to lately, update my address book, and maybe send them a brief email. At the end of the month (on the 27th through the 31st) I review my overall Circles lists. This way, over the course of each month I briefly review my entire social network, without spending too much time on it. (I try to spend 10 minutes or so a day.)</p>
<p>Periodically (right now weekly, but hopefully eventually monthly) I do some larger scale management of my Circles. Learning how to do this the first time is a pain, but once you know how it only takes a few minutes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I go to “Manage Circles” and select “People Who Have Added You”. I sort that list by “Not Yet in Circles”, “Select All” and add the people revealed to “FOLLOWS ME”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I then do the same with all of my Circles to update my “ALL” Circle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I copy my “ALL” circle to “Everyone But Pundits, Celebrities &amp; Noisy” and remove any Pundits, Celebrities or Noisy people from that Circle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When managing your Circles, remember the motto “Perfection is the Enemy of the Good”. You are the only one that sees who is in which Circle, and you can place people in multiple Circles. So your Circles don’t have to be perfect, just good enough. If you share a lot of private posts, concentrate on making sure that those more personal Circles are more accurate.</p>
<p>Using these approaches, you should find Circle management quick, and you won’t get mired down in Circle management for hours at a time.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Looking back, I wish I had this organization when I started on Google+ two weeks ago. By using some of these techniques from the beginning I would have made my life a lot easier. Over the next month I now have to go back and re-organize people and re-Circle them. I hope sharing these tips will make your use of Google+ simpler from the start!</p>
<p>Also, I expect that Google will be adding new features to make Google+ easier. For instance I’m hoping for #hashtags (the ability to tag posts into topic categories), favorites (the ability to tag posts into a persistent archive, hopefully with an option tag), ordering Circles, concentric Circles, and better integration with Google Reader. (I share my favorite blog posts on <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/ChristopherA" target="_self">Google Reader</a> at &#0160;and my best of best articles and posts in <a href="http://twitter.com/ChristopherA/favorites" target="_self">Twitter Favorites</a>&#0160;or <a href="http://delicious.com/christophera" target="_self">Delicious</a>.)</p>
<p>As with any new online feature, people are finding out new things and coming up with new ideas every day. So what are <em>your</em> methods for organizing your Circles and social graph?</p>

With Google+ almost two weeks into its test phase, conversation about this new social network service seems to be going in circles. Literally. That’s because Circles is the Google+ feature that users are generating the most buzz about. It’s Google’s answer to the problem of organizing your social graph online. If you’re not familiar with a social graph it’s a map of everyone you know and how they are related to you. Social graphs are tricky; as you try to define them you’ll inevitably run into some complications. [Post continues with more advice on managing Google+, your social graph, privacy, and time management tips.]

I really like the idea of using circles for social time management. One big problem I have with networks is that I feel committed (obligated?) to a certain, indistinct, level of communication - particularly with those people that social media has now kept me in 'contact' with, and whom in the old days I would have lost touch with. The end result is always a big time defecit and multiple layers of guilt. The idea of being able to apply some kind of equitable rationing/priority to circles may be a bit geeky... but it's preferable to non-specific angst  ;0)

I like your ideas; I've also been trying to play about with the circles & work out something that works for me. 
How, however, do you manage to add people to them, when you have quite so many (looking at the second list with the 1.3 etc) - I can only see 1.5 rows of circles! (OK, I know you can add someone by right clicking & going for the add to circle, but that's fiddly if you're block adding them!)

I've also got in the (equivalent of the) me circle my 'other' G+ account, that I've been using to see the effect of things like extended circles. Which I do find useful. 

Would be nice, if, at some point, rather than having 'stream' it was possible to see in a single stream all the updates from a set of circles, rather than 1 or all. (Unless that's something I've yet to find!) 
(That, and I want boolean logic for them, so I can have everyone who is in both a & b, but not a or b!)

<p>One of the common practices in the independent movie industry is to share favors to keep production costs low. I loan you use of a camera and you later do some editing for me on the cheap. Of course, it is often actually less direct then that: I loan you the camera, the community knows that I am generous, and when I need some editing time on the cheap, my social capital in the film community makes the resource available to me.</p>

<p>The real value of participating in this exchange is in the reciprocity and the social capital, but if the indie project is financially successful some ill will can arise about who really owes whom. One way that some creative producers deal with this is to have in effect two budgets, the real budget, and the virtual budget. Joss Whedon (creator and producer of <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>Serenity</em>, <em>Firefly</em>, <em>Dollhouse</em>, etc.) describes how he did this for his recent successful internet project&#0160;<a href="http://www.drhorrible.com/"><em>Dr. Horrible&#39;s Sing-Along Blog</em></a> in a recent <a href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2152">interview</a> at the Wharton business school:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlasica/2858261316/" style=" float: right;"><img alt="Joss Whedon photo" border="0" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3133/2858261316_40a63f6dd5_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Whedon:</strong> We got so much of this done through people doing us favors — department heads and people who have access to things. But you&#39;ve got to pay your day-to-day crew. The actors all did it for nothing. And we all did it for nothing. So, the production costs alone — the basic costs of filming the thing, and getting the locations, props and everything — ran a little over $200,000.</em></p>

<p><em>We had a secondary budget drawn up in case of a profit, wherein we were trying to find rates for Internet materials. In some cases they didn&#39;t exist. We used models that had been created by the guild for repurposed, or reused, material that we used for original [content], because this had never come up before.</em></p>

<p><em>We didn&#39;t want to leave a sour taste and say, &quot;Well, we made some money off of you guys being kind.&quot; It was like: No, everybody has to benefit from what they&#39;ve done, obviously not enormously — it&#39;s Internet money we&#39;re talking about — but as soon as we got in the black, we paid everybody off.</em></p>

<p><em>So that budget was probably about twice what the original budget was.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> You&#39;ve now earned more than twice the original cost?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> Yes.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Knowledge@Wharton:</strong> Which members of the production shared in the profits on the backend?</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Whedon:</strong> The crew that got paid, got paid. [Those] who didn&#39;t get paid [included people like] department heads who had jobs and could afford to do this as a lark.</em></p>

<p><em>As we go forward into profit, there are also residual schedules and payment schedules for all of the creative people. We&#39;re trying to figure out how that works.</em></p>

<p><em>From the start I also laid down a gross participation scheme for my three key actors and the other three writers. While the guild was negotiating for one-tenth of a yen, I said, &quot;How about we just get into some percentages.&quot; It was an opportunity to say to the guilds, &quot;Guess how much better we can do&quot; — which, in the case of the Internet, is the only way for the guilds to survive.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve used a similar technique for internet startups, where the favors and the free time often fly wild and cause the entrepreneurs problems later.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb is to get entrepreneurs to think one-third brains, one-third brawn, and one-third money. That is, people who bring knowledge, people, resources, brand, etc. get 1/3 of the outcome, people who actually work on the project get 1/3, and people who fronted the money or paid cash for expenses get the last third. Many people get a little equity from all three piles. If money comes in, the people who fronted cash get their money back first, then the other shares of revenues are distributed to everyone else based on the contributions.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t a perfect model, but an afternoon of discussion with a team early on the entrepreneurial process--using this as a starting point for discussions — is often very successful in addressing future issues head-on before people become invested in differing expectations.</p>

<p>I suspect that many other industries may have interesting creative ideas on how to monetize favor if an outcome is good, but otherwise give out reciprocity of favors or social capital in the common good. Do you know of any of these?</p>

<p>I was going through my first blog posts, and rediscovered a quote from 2003 Game Designer and Pundit <a href="http://www.costik.com/">Greg Costikyan</a> from his blog <a href="http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003_10_01_blogchive.html#106670940499938286">Games * Design * Art * Culture</a> that still resonates with me today:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Oh.... And you fellas. Sure, I like portraying the angry, um, middle-aged man... But, yet, I understand the importance of capital in bringing a product to market. But think about it: Back in the day, capital provided four essential things: development funding, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. In the digital era, manufacturing is trivial; distribution is less of an issue; marketing is, if anything, harder; and for most products (not games or film), development is easier and cheaper. Under the circumstances, isn&#39;t a realignment of the percentage of revenues due to artists a vital necessity? They =should= get a bigger piece of the pie. And since manufacturing is trivial, and development easier, the whole thing should be cheaper to consumers.</em></p>

<p><em>And whoever figures out how to market effectively online is going to be worth.... well, more money than I shall ever see in one place.”</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The reason this connects to me today is that this change has already happened, manufacturing and distribution have become significantly cheaper, and the costs of marketing have been growing. I don&#39;t agree with Greg that the costs of development have become that much cheaper — yes, the costs of certain kinds of development, in particular online products, have become cheaper, but the costs of content creation portion (even given user-generated content) has stayed the same or even grown.&#0160;</p>

<p>Thus we should be paying the creators and the marketers more, and manufacturing and distribution less. But financially there is a disconnect here — most of the benefits of the changes in the social web in the last 5 years have gone to the distributors. These are the Facebook, Hulu, and Twitter hubs in the social web. They don&#39;t manufacture, they don&#39;t develop content, they don&#39;t even market. They are fundamentally about distribution.</p>

A lot of my entrepreneurial colleagues in the intervening years have been trying to figure this out as well, most notably <a href="http://John_Buckman">John Buckman</a>, of <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a>, of &quot;We are not Evil&quot; fame who has been attempting to give more to the musicians:

<blockquote><p><em>“Find a way of getting music from the musician to their audience that&#39;s inexpensive and supports musicians. Otherwise, musical diversity will continue to greatly suffer under the current system where only mega-hits make money.</em></p>

<p><em>Musicians need to be in control and enjoy the process of having their music released. The systematic destruction of musician&#39;s lives is unacceptable: musicians are very close to staging a revolution (and some already have).”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet despite these lofty ideals, and a good match to the changes happening in the costs of distribution and manufacturing of music, Magnatune hasn&#39;t had a big impact on the music marketplace. Instead, Apple&#39;s iTunes is the becoming the biggest part of the ecosystem as a distributor of music — and they don&#39;t create music, and except in a relatively limited way they don&#39;t market music.</p><p>Obviously my sympathies are with the creators — I call myself one. Yet I feel that in all the creator marketplaces I&#39;ve been involved in lately, music, games, books, graphic novels, art, etc., that their portion of the pie is decreasing.</p><p>So why is distribution dominating earnings, when given the changes caused by the Internet they should be earning less? Is it a cultural disconnect where our culture has not adapted to the changes fast enough? Is it is a supply and demand problem where there is an oversupply of creators? Is there less demand? Or is it that there the barrier of entry created by the Long Tail such that access to the creators is only by these big distribution sites?</p><p>Help me answer this question, and maybe I can help the creators so that they can deliver to you amazing stories, songs, and art.</p>

<a href="http://www.blogactionday.org" style=" float: right;"><img alt="" border="0" class="selected " src="http://www.blogactionday.org/imgs/badges/bad-180-150.jpg" /></a>
<p>Late this evening while catching up on my feeds, I saw for the first time that this year&#39;s <a href="http://site.blogactionday.org/">Blog Action Day</a>&#0160;is on the topic of <a href="http://site.blogactionday.org/general/8-great-climate-change-resources-for-your-blog-action-day-post/">Climate Change</a>. This event is sponsored yearly by <a href="http://www.change.org/">Change.org</a>. I wish I had known earlier as this would have been a great exercise for my sustainable MBA students at BGI.edu, as they are all creating their blogs this week for my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2009/09/teaching-using-the-social-web-for-social-change-at-bgiedu.html">class</a> &quot;Using the Social Web for Social Change&quot;.</p>

<p>This is now the second time this week that a significant event on this topic has slipped by me. Apparently on Monday the 19th there will be a <a href="http://www.socialmediacsr.com/">Social Media for Sustainability Conference</a>&#0160;in San Francisco, that seems to have a really good <a href="http://www.socialmediacsr.com/speakers.html">list of speakers</a>. But I only heard about it yesterday.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that as a blogger I&#39;m not hooked in tight with the sustainability community — clearly because of my BGIedu connections I am sympathetic, but I mainly for the last I&#39;ve have been writing about the social web or the iPhone. My disconnect demonstrates the challenge of communicating outside your own social circles, both for those trying to create change, and to those that might benefit from the message.</p>

<p>Which brings me to a point that I need to make to my students – we have to figure out how to get ourselves out of info ruts. I teach a technique of Scan Focus Act that is really good at letting you manage your time to read and connect to a larger number of people via blogs, however, if you are too insular, you still may not get the information you need on time. It is through the weak links that we often get our useful information from, and we have to take time to maintain those weak links as well as the strong links to our community that are more easy to maintain as they are more satisfying.</p>

<p>Other then the fact that I learned about it late, I&#39;m reasonably pleased by the example that the Blog Action Day website serves for my students. It satisfies the basic principles of identification and connection, and has a number of good <a href="http://www.blogactionday.org/en/takeaction">calls for action</a>, the first being to register your blog.&#0160;The links featuring blog posts with&#0160;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/A-Green-Blog-Action-Day/" style="color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important; ">whitehouse.gov</a>, UK prime minister&#0160;<a href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20931" style="color: blue !important; text-decoration: underline !important; cursor: text !important; ">Gordon Brown</a>, and a number of major websites, including the third on the list being in spanish, give the site a credibility. The most recents tab gave the site authenticity. I think I probably would have made the signup process shorter, and had users fill out information later, but it wasn&#39;t bad.&#0160;</p>

<p>There are a lot of things at this website which will be a good jumping off point for my students to think about as they work on their on blogs on sustainability, and their future Social Change media projects.</p>

That&#39;s because it lies between a smaller size where good conversations naturally occur, and a larger size where you can take full advantage of different activities that work well for larger groups.</p>

<p>I talk about this a bit in my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">Group Threshold</a> and <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> posts, where I call the group threshold size of between 10 and 24 people the&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">“Judas Number”</a> nadir, or low point. These group threshold nadirs exist when groups are too large for some processes to function effectively, but too small for others to work.</p>

<p>I am particularly aware of this threshold when I host small parties at my home. At 7 or so people everything just seems to work — conversations flow, everybody gets to participate, and everyone has fun. A the numbers climb past 10 I find that I as the host have to work harder, to be more aware of making sure that everyone is having a good time and that no one is left out. At some point as a party gets larger things just begin to flow again, as there are enough people that small groups can form and conversation flows well once more.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen this at business meetings. When my entrepreneurial companies were small an “all hands” meeting could be incredibly effective. All the issues and ideas got brought up, and everyone felt committed to our decisions. However, as these meeting grew, at some point the “all hands” meeting took too long and started requiring process and rules to be effective. The energy this consumed also diminished much of the efficacy of the meeting.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border=1" title="Four Table Braid"><img alt="Four Table Braid" height="137" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2434/3959741597_77ffe2ca15_m.jpg" style="border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: black; border-right-color: black; border-bottom-color: black; border-left-color: black; " title="Card from Four Table Braid" width="240" /></a>One tool that I&#39;ve used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which <a href="http://www.theworldcafe.com/">The World Café</a> and <a href="http://"></a><a href="http://www.conversationcafe.org/">Conversation Café</a> are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called <a href="http://www.theworldcafe.com/articles/cafetogo.pdf">Cafe To Go</a>.</p>

<p>The Braid is a little more organized then the more ad-hoc Café Method. When you start a meeting you are given a small card that tells you which table to sit at for each round. Each table is assigned a scribe for each round to take notes at the table, and to report out the notes to everyone who arrives for the next round.</p>

<p>One nice thing about the organization of The Braid is that over the course of a number of rounds you&#39;ll have a brand new group of people to talk to during each round. Thus over the course of an hour or so you&#39;ll actually get to have a relatively short yet rich conversation with almost everyone in the room, rather than with just a few.</p>

<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Four Table Braid"><img alt="Four Table Braid" height="453" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2622/3960601974_652a29b96f.jpg" width="433" /></a> There are different forms of The Braid for different numbers of tables and sizes of groups, but my favorite is the Four Table Braid for groups of a minimum of 16 to a maximum of 28 people. One of the peculiar things about this Braid is that it seems to function well if people arrive at different times. The Braid fills first table A with 4 people so that they can begin talking, then fills table B, C, and D the same way. Once those tables are full, new arrivals are woven into The Braid one at a time until all tables have 5 people, then 6, then the max of 7 for a total of 28 people.</p>

<p>Another nice thing about the Four Table Braid is that no one needs to be the scribe more then once; the task is equally shared among all but the last 8 to arrive in a group of 28. Also, in just 4 rounds with 16 people, 90%+ of the participants have met. With 28 people, you simply only need 5 rounds to match the same 90%+ meeting percentage.</p>

<p>I find The Braid useful for a variety of different situations. The simplest usage is as a group warming and introduction exercise. You need not do more then two or three rounds in order for more than half of the people to have met each other. The Braid is also useful with a focused objective. For instance, I once used it after a game designers&#39; conference, with each table having a list of &quot;game design laws&quot; where the participants were asked to either give an example that was in favor of the law or contradicted the law. It also can be useful in combination with a variety of other group process techniques, for instance after an MG Taylor Take-A-Panel, where each participant first creates a page telling a story about themselves 15 years in the future and then the group uses The Braid to discover common insights. The Braid can also be good before an Open Space or other unconference event.</p>

<p>I am including here my templates for a <a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/files/Four%20Table%20Braid.pdf">Four Table Braid</a>. It includes 28 cards for printing on Avery business card paper, 4 table pages with instructions for participants, and 1 page with instructions for the host. I make these available as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/" rel="license">CC-BY-NC-SA</a> license. I welcome any DTP folks out there who would like to make these documents more functional or more attractive.</p>

<p>A Three Table Braid is easy to figure out by hand, but larger Braids are more difficult. I&#39;ve never figured out an algorithm for designing these quickly (any math wizzes out there?) so I&#39;ve posted my <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tSZvgWmkax0xsBfKY3Lj69Q&amp;gid=0">spreadsheet</a> for the Four Table Braid for those of you who might wish to figure out how to implement larger numbers of tables. I would love to have a Ten Table Braid as a warm up exercise for a small unconference.</p>

EXCERPT:
[intro skipped] One tool that I've used to manage these odd-sized groups in the past is what I call “The Braid”. It is derived from a group process called the Café Method, of which The World Café and Conversation Café are excellent examples. In The Café Method, people meet in smaller groups around tables, and then flow from table to table sharing ideas, but ideally keeping each table at 4-7 people. There is an excellent free PDF guide to the Café Method offered by The World Café called Cafe To Go. [rest of post continues with more details on The Braid...]

As such, you should make sure that your online passwords are as strong as possible. This article will provide some general guidelines for doing so.</p>

<h3>Multiple Passwords</h3>

<p>Note that I said that you want to ensure your passwords, plural, are strong. That&#39;s because you&#39;ll want at least two. They should both be good passwords, but they should be used in different places.</p>

<p>Use a “non-secure” password for any non-financial websites that you sign up for, such as Facebook and Twitter. Use a different “secure” password for places where your credit card is on file or money changes hands, such as eBay, Amazon, your bank, and your stock broker. Because banks and other financial institutions are more likely to maintain good security over their transactions, reserving a password only for those sites makes it more likely that they will remain safe.</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be the tip of the iceberg. You might want to create a third password for shopping sites, or another one for less reliable sites that you might use. Ideally you would use a different password for every site. That would surely be the most secure, as someone breaking into one site couldn&#39;t get into your other accounts — but clearly that is too many passwords to remember. As a compromise, I&#39;ll talk shortly about an easy technique to both remember and vary your passwords.</p>

<h3>Criteria for Bad Passwords</h3>

<p>In a moment, I&#39;m going to suggest an excellent method for creating a secure password. However, if you prefer to use your own methods, be sure to watch out for these common problems which could result weak passwords.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not use obvious words. There was a time when “password” was one of the most common passwords on the internet (along with “root” and “”).
</li>
<li>Do not use words from the dictionary as passwords. Some of the oldest password crackers just dumped the entire dictionary at an account to see if any of them worked as passwords. This doesn&#39;t apply just to English either. It&#39;s easy enough for a password cracker to use any dictionary, whether it be French or Klingon.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on a dictionary word with simple substitutions. Though I&#39;ll talk in a bit about the advantage of substituting letters for numbers, a dictionary word with simple substitutions will be no more secure than just a dictionary word. That&#39;s because later password crackers would run not only the dictionary, but also a dictionary with a few substitutions, such as “0”s for “o”s and “1”s for “l”s.
</li>
<li>Do not depend on multiple dictionary words concatenated together. If you were concatenating three or four words, you might be OK, but password crackers were checking two word dictionary concatenations a decade ago.
</li>
<li>Do not use obvious names of people or places you know. Your girlfriend&#39;s name, your street address, and your favorite pet&#39;s name are all straight out. A password cracker may not be able to guess these (though testing against common names is another strategy used by some), but if someone who knows you can break in by hand, that&#39;s no good either.
</li>
<li>Do not write down your password, and especially do not write down your password in an online or computer file. If you picked the best password in the world, it doesn&#39;t matter if someone else can easily look at it.
</li>
<li>Do not keep the same password forever. It&#39;s pain, but you really should change it every year or two, at least, just in case someone has broken into one of your accounts, and you don&#39;t know it.
</li>
</ul>


<h3>A Method for Creating a Strong Password</h3>

<p>So you&#39;ve learned a lot about what makes a bad password. What makes a good password? The following suggests one method that you can use to create a password that&#39;s not easily breakable — but which is easily memorable.
</p>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3952128651/" onclick="window.open(this.href,&#39;_blank&#39;,&#39;scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39;); return false" style="float: right;" title="Safari by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Password Meter" height="500" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2543/3952128651_b6842a0ecf.jpg" title="Password Meter" width="363" /></a>

<ol>
<li>Pick a short phrase, or an obscure but memorable long word. For example “amber waves” or “perspicacious”.
</li>
<li>Shorten it to 7 characters, such as “ambrwvs” or “prspccus”.
</li>
<li>Convert a letter other then first to a number. You can use those obvious substitutions here (e.g., A=4, B=8, E=3, G=6, I=1, L=1, O=0, R=2, S=5, T=7), since they&#39;re not your only method of security. This might produce “ambrwv5” or “pr5pccus”.
</li>
<li>The next part is the key trick: use a specific letter from the domain name for the last character for your password and capitalize it. For example, you might add the third o from google, producing “ambrwv5O” or “pr5pccusO” for a GMail password. This ensures that even if
you use your password at multiple sites, anyone who steals the password can&#39;t use it another website unless they know the trick. You can also use this trick with your computer&#39;s password by choosing the third letter from the name you use for the computer, or for a password required for a software application, by using the third letter from the app&#39;s name.
</li>
<li>You should check the quality of your example password at <a href="http://www.passwordmeter.com/">Password Meter</a> -- “ambrwv5O” weight is 54%, which is pretty good for an 8-character password, “pr5pccusO” is 44%, which is OK, but both are significantly better because they will be different at every site.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The same technique can be used with longer words to create more secure financial passwords. These might be easier to remember if you use the first letters from a sentence or poem that you can remember to generate the initial phrase. For example, “My first pet&#39;s name was Arthur the Valiant Dog” would generate “MfpnwAtVD”. Again, you convert one or more letters to a number (“Mfpnw4tVD”).&#0160;</p>

<p>When you add the domain letters to your secure password, you can strengthen it again by adding multiple letters, possibly to different parts of the password. For example, add the first and last letter the domain name. Thus a Google Gmail password might add a “G” to start and an “E” to the end, producing “GMfpnw4tVDE”. This one rates 70% at Password Meter, but again is actually better because of the site variation.</p><p>Also, most financial sites will accept, and some even require, passwords to include a symbol — I don&#39;t recommend this with your&#0160;“non-secure” password as many ordinary sites do not allow symbols, but if you need one, then the following are some easy to remember substitutions:&#0160;A=@, E=#, I=!, L=!, O=* S=$, or you can just put a symbol between the first domain letter and the passphrase (many sites will not allow a symbol at beginning or end). For example, password above could become&#0160;“G$Mfpnw4tVDE” which raises this password&#39;s Password Meter rating to 90%.</p><p>With these two passwords you&#39;ll find it very easy to both remember and be secure against most password based attacks.</p>

<h3>A High-Tech Alternative</h3>

<p>An interesting high-security alternative that works best on webpages is to use <a href="http://supergenpass.com/">SuperGenPass Bookmarklet</a> — it takes the domain name plus a private master password and creates a unique high security password for each website based on a cryptographic hash of the two. It
can generate any length of password and you can&#39;t really get a password that is more secure, but there is the occasional web page that the bookmarklet doesn&#39;t work on. Fortunately, you can save <a href="http://supergenpass.com/mobile/">http://supergenpass.com/mobile/</a> as an .html file to your disk and you can open it anytime to manually create a supergenpass password for a website that you can copy and paste. I&#39;ve even used SuperGenPass on my iPhone.</p>

<h3>Secondary Authentication</h3>

<p>Many sites require you to give them additional identification, such as mother&#39;s maiden name, the name of your pet, etc. Crackers have broken
into various celebrities accounts — such as Paris Hilton and Sarah Palin — by researching this information and asking for a password reset.</p>

<p>You can avoid this danger by treating these authentication requests like passwords. I have a standard word that I use for my mother&#39;s maiden name, my pet, etc. They&#39;re things that I can easily remember, but no one could figure out. Like the password technique above, I can easily add a letter from the domain. I&#39;ve had no problem with customer service phone calls to banks; when they ask me for my mother&#39;s maiden name I just spell it out my encode word for them.</p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>

<p>None of these approaches is perfect, but they significantly raise the bar against any but the most determined cracker from breaking into one
of your accounts. The domain letter technique will also make it very difficult for a cracker to break into your more important financial accounts if he gets access to your password from a poorly secured website or masquerades as a legitimate website or email by using a&#0160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a> attack.</p>

<p>However, don&#39;t ever think that a good password is the be-all and end-all of security. You also have to protect it adequately, and that doesn&#39;t just mean not writing it down, as mentioned above. You also must be alert to “social engineering”, where a cracker might call you or email you pretending to be associated with some institute where you might have an account.</p>

<p>Security is a constant game of oneupmanship between you and the black hats. Thus you need to ensure that you&#39;re always alert to the current best practices for setting, resetting, and protecting all of your security information on the internet.</p>

I had an idea once to start a very famous community, ask for login info and use those usernames and passwords to gain on other sites, since most people use the same password for most sites. It sounds silly, but I think that's how Twitter was hacked some time back. Moral of the story, don't use same passwords on every site. Nice post btw Chris, I need to start creating pass myself.

I do know that in fact there are criminals that host "honey pot" websites with semi-legitimate content (games, files, music, porn,etc.) solely for the opportunity to collect passwords from unknowing users. So you need to be particularly careful the more fly-by-night the website is. I've not heard of any social media / mashup websites set up for this purpose, but I would not be surprised if there was.

Thank you Chris for the detailed article on password best practices. I like to use roboform for the purpose and of course having a sophisticated randomized combination of different passwords will greatly reduce the chances of being compromised and thats where the roboform software comes in to manage the passwords.

Very nice post. I especially like the unique-per-site approach.

One thing you didn't mention was OpenID, which I with gurgling joy register with whenever the opportunity arises. I wish the world used OpenID so I could just have one gigantically monstrous password to rule my world with.

Mastery of language requires learning the meanings of thousands of words. The average native English language speaker uses in the realm of 12,000 to 20,000 words, whereas a college graduate would use 20-25,000 words. Shakespeare actively used more then 30,000 words, and his vocabulary was estimated to be over 66,000 words. Yet there are, at the very least, a quarter of a million distinct English words, excluding inflections, and words from technical and regional vocabularies. The Oxford English dictionary defines more then 600,000 words.</p>

<p>But mastery of words is not enough to allow effective conversation.</p>

<p>That is because words themselves don&#39;t have meaning; the meaning is provided by the people who use them. Meaning is in the mind, not in the words.</p>

<p>Words also require context, outside of which they may have different meanings. For instance, consider the word &quot;trust&quot;. To a banker or CPA &quot;trust&quot; is a property held by someone to manage for someone else&#39;s benefit. To a cryptographer it is the confidence in a future outcome based on probabilistic mathematics and past experience. Finally, to the lay person &quot;trust&quot; is about honesty. &quot;Spin&quot; is another example of a word that changes with context; to a weaver it is the production of thread, to a physicist it is a property of elemental particles, to an athlete it is a type of exercise class, and to a politician or public relations professional it is a way to tell a story to sway pubic opinion.</p>

<h4>Creating a Shared Language</h4>

<p></p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Life With Alacrity Wordle" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b " src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a577c005970b-320pi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Life With Alacrity Wordle" /></a>Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language. They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that the linguistic root of communication is the Latin verb&#0160;<a href="http://artfl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.18:3557.lewshort" title="Latin definition of commūnĭco">commūnĭco</a>&#0160;&#0160;— which doesn&#39;t mean &quot;to communicate&quot; but instead means &quot;to share something with someone, to take or receive a part of, to partake, to participate in&quot;. Thus the creation of a shared language takes us to the roots of communication.</p>

<p>Without taking the time time to create shared language, groups have a difficult time forging mutual trust. Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something. Without a shared language commitments can be hard to make, and if misunderstood can lead to disagreements. These group formation phases — trust building, goal clarification, and commitment — are essential.</p>

<p>Yet the art of creating a shared language together is not taught. Some individuals and groups do it intuitively while others will just let it evolve naturally over time. However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact.</p>

<h4>Using Shared Artifacts</h4>

<p>A shared artifact is the creation of an object or shared space that is created collaboratively. It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: &quot;Is this what you mean when you are talking about this? I use these words, so suppose we change it to this? Is that what you mean? Does this reflect our new shared understanding?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="WatsonCrick" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c " src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce5085970c-120pi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="WatsonCrick" /></a><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Napkin-idea-original-concept-300x293" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c " src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5ce82e4970c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a> Examples of shared artifacts include Watson &amp; Crick&#39;s Tinker-Toy DNA model. Each scientist would work on the model separately, then use grad students to carry the model around to his partner to express certain ideas. Both Compaq Computer and Southwest Airlines were reportedly established after their founders wrote their ideas down together on a table napkin, another shared artifact.</p>

<p>Both of these examples show an important factor in shared artifacts — if the shared artifact is not constrained then it will be too large or complex for the group to reach some measure of completion. Finishing the shared artifact really helps establish trust and the connections between the participants.</p>

<p>A shared artifact is also useful because flooding someone with information and terms gives no assurance that the recipient has gained knowledge of the subject. Instead, the act of creation confirms to both parties that the knowledge was successfully assimilated.</p>

<p>Another advantage to creating a shared artifact is that it isolates any problems to the task at hand. Often there are differences in status, purpose, or perspective that can get in the way of group formation, but a focus on a common task of the creation of a neutral shared artifact allows those issues to come later as the participants develop the trust and shared language required to talk about those tough issues.</p>

<p>The best facilitators know what kinds of shared artifacts work best for different groups under different circumstances. Sometimes a shared artifact is just a model of a process drawn on a white wall. Often it is a creation of a mission statement or joint objectives. I personally like taking old mind maps and trying to recreate them anew with more recent knowledge.</p>

<h4>The Future of Shared Language</h4>

<p>The nature of shared language is changing in the 21st century. The conjoined social networks in the blogosphere — via Facebook, Twitter, or the attendee-focused Unconference — cause new terminology and new language to form ever faster. I&#39;ve personally seen words like &quot;retweet&quot; and &quot;attribution&quot; gain important contextual meaning within my social networks. As with any shared language, newcomers have difficulty discovering their meanings only by osmosis.</p>

<p>Tagging is another means by which shared language is rapidly expanding. Certain words are gaining context through common use at Delicious.com, Technorati, Flickr, and other tag-enabled web sites.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, all of these new shared languages are built upon shared artifacts. Twitter, Facebook, Delicious.com and others sites each create constraints on how language is shared and with whom. However, there is little purposeful social design being applied to these new shared languages. Though there may be shared artifacts, they are not purposefully facilitated.</p>

<p>Will these increasingly organic shared languages prove better than more purposefully created ones or worse? Is social language facilitation the next big thing in social network? Or is there just not enough space for it within the tightly constrained social artifacts of the internet? These are questions that we as social software technologists need to address as the future of the internet increasingly becomes the present of our social groupings.</p>

[brief summary of longer post] The average native English language speaker uses in the realm of 12,000 to 20,000 words, whereas a college graduate would use 20-25,000 words…Every time a new group of people meet together — whether in a team, in a marketplace, or in a community — one of the first activities they must do together is create a shared language…They do this in order to communicate more effectively together, to put a context on the words that they have in common, to construct a shared understanding in their minds based both on available information and their individual diversity of experience…Without a shared language there will be no clarity on mutual goals — whether it involves working together, transacting a trade, or creating something…However, some facilitators have learned that one of the best ways to help a group form a shared language is by having the group create together a shared artifact…It allows the individuals participating to ask the questions: "Is this what you mean when you are talking about this?..an important factor in shared artifacts — if the shared artifact is not constrained then it will be too large or complex for the group to reach some measure of completion…Often there are differences in status, purpose, or perspective that can get in the way of group formation, but a focus on a common task of the creation of a neutral shared artifact allows those issues to come later as the participants develop the trust and shared language required to talk about those tough issues.…The conjoined social networks in the blogosphere — via Facebook, Twitter, or the attendee-focused Unconference — cause new terminology and new language to form ever faster…Or is there just not enough space for it within the tightly constrained social artifacts of the internet?…These are questions that we as social software technologists need to address as the future of the internet increasingly becomes the present of our social groupings.

I'm wondering whether the creation of such language is adding to an intellectual, generational and cultural divisiveness that is already prevalent in our society. Can we design tools that serve as bridges? Using the web for social change is a powerful concept, particularly if we can broaden the audience. This is a fascinating topic.

I've not really thought of Shared Language in the context of divisiveness — Shared Language tends to be a function of small groups. Thus I more think of the divisiveness is coming from the fact that Shared Language typically evolves naturally in a small group, but fails to evolve naturally in larger groups. Possibly a better understanding of how Shared Language and tools to facilitate it like Shared Artifacts function will make it easier for larger groups to grow a Shared Language together.

Shared artifacts are also known as models; the best form of understanding of business that I have found yet is when you develop simulators with practitioners. The quality of the the output is only surpassed by the shared understanding created through healthy challenge to the way things actually work.

<p></p>
BGI offers an MBA and Certificate program for professionals to learn how to build enterprises that are financially successful, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. Students have to learn everything that they&#39;d have to learn in an ordinary MBA program — profit and loss, how to read a balance sheet, business plan creation, macroeconomics, quantitative analysis, corporate strategy, how to manage and motivate people, and a basic understanding of all the components of business such as operations, marketing, distribution, sales, etc. In addition, BGI student have to learn green and sustainability topics — the triple-bottom line, environmental accounting, sustainable energy, social justice, systems thinking, organization change, right livelihood and much more.<p></p>
That broad a curriculum doesn&#39;t give students a lot of room for electives, but the MBA program allows for students to take one 3 credit hour course. This year students can choose from three: one course on social responsibility, a second course on climate change and carbon trading, and my course on the social web.<p></p>
The BGI pedagogy (a new term I have just learned, meaning &quot;teaching method&quot;) is a mixed hybrid of online sessions along with a number of very intensive in-person classroom sessions. This allows the MBA student to continue working while taking classes in either a 2-year or 3-year program.<p></p><a href="http://www.channelrock.ca/" style="float: left;"><img alt="The Cobb House at Channel Rock" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5cdf579970c " src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5cdf579970c-120wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a><a href="http://www.islandwood.org/" style="float: right;"><img alt="The IslandWood Main Hall" class="at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5776c2e970b " src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef0120a5776c2e970b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a> Students kick off their BGI experience at <a href="http://www.channelrock.ca/">Channel Rock</a> on Cortes Island in British Columbia, where the live for a week at an off-the-grid wilderness retreat, where they get the chance to experience and practice sustainability. Over the course of the year students and faculty meet in intensive classroom sessions for a 4-day weekend once a month at the &#0160;<a href="http://www.islandwood.org/">IslandWood</a> environmental learning center on <a href="http://www.bainbridgechamber.com/">Bainbridge Island</a> near Seattle, Washington. Between sessions, the classes utilize a variety of online distance-learning technologies such as <a href="http://www.elluminate.com/">Elluminate</a> to support student learning.<p></p>
I like this hybrid format because it fits my ideals of group formation — bonding and team building work best in the immersive, in-person experience, yet the online technologies allow students to have greater flexibility, deeper focus, and more control over their engagement while remote. BGI offers students both.<p></p>
When the class is complete, I plan to offer the syllabus, course plan, presentations, etc. online as open courseware, so that other schools can use these materials as a basis for future classes. In the meantime, expect to see some more posts here over the next few months.<p></p>

Hi Christopher,

We've done a lot of work in this area in the past couple of years at Changemakers.com.  We've been running online competitions to surface social innovation with corporate partners like Nike and foundation partners like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  We've learned a lot and would welcome the chance to spread some of that knowledge.  Good luck, looks like a great place!

<blockquote><p><strong>Defining &quot;Noncommercial&quot;: &#0160;A Study of how the Online Population Understands &quot;Noncommercial&quot; Use</strong><br /><a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Defining_Noncommercial" style="color: #2a5db0; " target="_blank">http://wiki.<wbr />creativecommons.org/Defining_<wbr />Noncommercial</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>The topic is somewhat of a sticky one, as there are many competing interests. There are content creators who wish to profit from their work, there are other content creators who don&#39;t want anyone to profit (even themselves), and of course there are content creators who want everything to be free provided you share free content back.</p>

<p>There also is not agreement on what noncommerical means. There are some clearly commercial uses, but there are also various type advertising and sponsorship and use by non-profit or education institutions where money changes hands (such as a card at a museum gift shop). Finally, there is use in news or criticism where users feel that they are not restricted due to the rules of fair-use.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that there is anything definitely &quot;new&quot; in this report, but there is some consensus and some interesting facts:</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The vast majority (73%) of creators define “commercial use” as a&#0160;use where money is made, 76% of content users agreed.</li>
<li>33% of content users thought that individual use was&#0160;noncommercial use, whereas only 19% of the content creators&#0160;believed so.</li>
<li>Content creators rate uses by individuals as being less&#0160;commercial (89%) – unless the user is a professional who earns&#0160;money (35%)</li>
<li>13% of content users thought that fun, enjoyment, entertainment&#0160;and artistic use was noncommercial use, whereas only 3% of&#0160;content creators believed so.</li>
<li>52% of the content creators don&#39;t believe that content users&#0160;understand the noncommercial provision, and 43% believe that&#0160;content users don&#39;t respect the term.</li>
<li>50% of the content creators have been contacted about licensing&#0160;their noncommercial content, 24% of the content creators have&#0160;attempted to contact another creator about appropriate use of a&#0160;CC license.</li>
<li>There is a lack of agreement on a lot of edge cases of&#0160;noncommercial use. For instance, some feel cost-recovery is&#0160;acceptable noncommercial use, money exchanged hands for a&#0160;charitable use would be noncommercial, or use by a for-profit&#0160;company where no money changed hands would still be noncommercial.</li>
<li>There is some interesting analysis of what people might be&#0160;willing to change their mind about. For instance, before focus&#0160;group participation only 8% thought that use for charitable&#0160;purposes for social good would be noncommercial, but after the&#0160;focus group 17% did.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all an excellent report, with lots of good data in it for further investigation. If you are involved in user-generated content, offer users creative-commons licenses, or are a consumer or provider of commercial content online, I recommend you take the time to understand these issues more deeply.</p>

<p>My personal take on this report is that the noncommercial provisions of the CC license need more clarification and there needs to be more user education. In addition I feel that Creative Commons also needs to look at the commercial use side of the problem. I appreciate the recent efforts toward a <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CCPlus">CC Plus</a> metadata, but it isn&#39;t enough.

</p>

<p><a class="image" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png" title="Image:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png"><img alt="Image:Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png" border="0" height="31" src="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/4/49/Cc-by-nc-3.0-88x31.png" width="88" /></a> <span style="font-size: 280%">+</span> <a class="image" href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/File:Commercial-license-button.png" title="Image:Commercial-license-button.png"><img alt="Image:Commercial-license-button.png" border="0" height="31" src="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/images/9/91/Commercial-license-button.png" width="88" /></a></p> 

For instance Creative Commons should take a principled stand on what exactly &quot;fair use&quot; is; make it easier for those who offer NC licenses to also offer a standard commercial license for common uses; and possibly creating a standard for what &quot;fair rights&quot; are in commercial license (i.e. fair to both the content creator and the content user).<p></p>

<p>There are also problems in the area of attribution, as all Creative Commons licenses except Public Domain have the BY provision. These get particularly difficult when you have a remix of content from many creators. There&#39;s also difficulty in the fact that it&#39;s not stated what places attribution must be listed in. For instance, can you do a movie or a podcast with remixed content, but have the attribution credits be a link? Or must they be credits in the media itself?</p><p>All are interesting problems that I hope Creative Commons will address in the future.</p>

BODY:
<p>In <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">my first article</a>&#0160;in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved.</p>

<p>In order to better define <em>who</em> constitutes the tightly-knit &quot;participant community&quot; upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals&#39; involvement in a group.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Power Laws</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366611997/" title="Pareto Principle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Pareto Principle" height="179" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3616/3366611997_95f255e4a3_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>The best-known power law is probably the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>, which is otherwise known as the &quot;80/20 law.&quot; It&#39;s been overused throughout the years; Pareto&#39;s actual law only said that 80% of the wealth would be held by 20% of the population.</p>

<p>However, it offers a fine example of how power laws work. They generally describe a discrepancy between intensity and population: inevitably, some people do a lot more of the work in any social situation. Other examples include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf&#39;s Law</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367563212/" title="Long Tail Curve by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img height="174" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3367563212_8aa7a62c6f_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>which suggests that the frequency of a word&#39;s usage is inversely proportionate to its ranking among words (making the second ranked word appear half as much, the third a quarter as much, etc), and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">long tail</a>, which talks about selling a very large number of items in a very small individual quantity.</p>

<p>For online communities, which have been the focus of most of my studies on the topic of community sizes, I&#39;ve found that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_inequality">participation inequality</a> power rule is very apt.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366764093/" title="Participation Inequality by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality" height="192" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3613/3366764093_29495ce5b4_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>This term comes from Will Hill of AT&amp;T Laboratories, who said, &quot;A major reason why user-contributed content rarely turns into a true community is that all aspects of Internet use are characterized by severe participation inequality.&quot; It&#39;s often equated with the 1% law, though I like to be more precise and say that 90% of an online community tends to be lurkers, 9% tends to be intermittent participants, and 1% tends to be active participants.</p>

<p>These values heavily influence online community sizes that are larger than the tightly-knit communities group thresholds that I previously discussed.</p>

<h3>Power Laws &amp; Group Thresholds</h3>

<p>When I wrote about tightly-knit communities in my first article, I didn&#39;t consider the degree of participation. That&#39;s certainly an entirely valid model for some types of groups. Corporations, for example, ideally should be entirely filled with active participants, while Skotos&#39; online game <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/">Castle Marrach</a> also fits into the category due to the implicit requirements it creates for participation. There are some challenges to grow this type of community, since you&#39;re only searching for a specific type of high-energy participant — but they can be overcome if you offer sufficient incentive (such as a salary or a lot of internal feedback).</p>

<p>However, most communities, and in particular, online communities, will not fall into this category, and thus when we&#39;re looking at group thresholds, we have to measure them against the number of <em>active participants</em>, not against the number of total members. Thus, for groups which allow for non-participation, we&#39;ll often measure 10% (or maybe 1%) of the group size against the group thresholds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net">RPGnet</a>, one of the community sites that Skotos runs, offers a good example of this. We regularly see monthly uniques of approximately 200,000 users. However we probably have about 20,000 active registered users, confirming the lurker:participant ratio. When we recognize that only 2,000 of those are particularly active participants and that they&#39;re divided upon 6 successful forums, we start to see how community numbers that actually match the group thresholds can gel.</p>

<p>You can reverse this approach and look at active participants first. During some recent consulting for a local non-profit organization with 60 active online members, I was able to infer that their broader community was around 6000, which turned out to fairly accurately predict the total number of people who came to their live events over the course of a year.</p>

<p>Generally, this logic can be applied to a community of any size. You first measure whether it&#39;s an all-participant community or one that matches an existing power law, and then you use the corrected community number to truly measure which of the group thresholds may apply to it.</p>

<h3>Power Laws &amp; Leaders</h3>

<p>The power laws can also help you to measure the number of leaders in a community. Inevitably all of your participants will become leaders of some sort, while your high-level participants will become the top-tier leaders.</p>

<p>I noted this in my first discussions of group threshold. In a group of 7 members, you can reasonably expect to have one higher level participant, and thus the one leader that we saw naturally appear. Similarly in a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">Judas group of 13</a>, there&#39;s the opportunity for more than one leader to appear, creating the possibility for the first hierarchical conflicts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609602/" title="Participation Inequality 90 9 1 by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality 90 9 1" height="153" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3600/3367609602_4445e5cfb9_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" width="240" /></a>Understanding your count of leaders can help you see how to grow groups. For example when I first created <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com">iPhoneWebDev</a> I had to do an immense amount of effort to grow the community. This is because with Participation Inequality I had to grow the group by 10 members before I got the least amount of help increasing the content of the group and I had to grow it by 100 members before I had someone who was doing as much work as I was to create content.</p>

<p>At 100 members, with my first active participant, we continued to grow, but we were both were working hard and felt rather lonely.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3366786135/" title="Participation Inequality 700 70 7 by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality 700 70 7" height="196" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3366786135_53f8ebcf47_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>I finally saw the group stabilize, then take off on its own, when it hit 600-700 members, and that shows how beautifully the power logs work hand-in-hand with the group thresholds. With 700 members, I could reasonably expect there to be 7 leaders. In other words, I had a committee of leaders: the perfect size for a starting&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Working_Group">working group</a>.</p><p></p>

<p>From my experience with other online groups, if the iPhoneWebDev grows to over 10,000 members, I can expect that there will be some transition issues. As the core active community members exceed 100 people I will start having some <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number">Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number</a> problems, typically social contract failures. These can be solved by either adding some hierarchy (appointing some people to be official &quot;staff&quot;), or by starting to break the group into sub-communities.</p>

<h3>Varying the Power Laws</h3>

<p>In my first article, I noted that it&#39;s possible to expend additional energy to make tightly-knit groups able to function effectively at non-optimal sizes. It is similarly possible for the values of the participation inequality sized groups to change by expending more energy. Conversely, a drain on energy&#0160;may decrease this ratio.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609374/" title="Participation Inequality - High Energy by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality - High Energy" height="169" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3367609374_3975fe9bf7_m.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" width="240" /></a>For example when I used to run AOL forums I would frequently reward first-time participants with free time (at that time worth $5 an hour) if they asked good questions or offered valuable input. CompuServe similarly offered constructive feedback by telling users how many responses they&#39;d received to a new comment when they logged back in, encouraging them to leave lurker status. More energy in the community — driven either by the moderators, good social software design, or by a greater commitment by its members — can allow you to increase the active participant percentage, maybe times 2, or even 4, but even with a lot of effort not by an order of magnitude.</p><p>As a group grows in size, I believe the participation inequality worsens. A huge Yahoo! group with a million members might have moved from a 90/9/1 ratio to 95/4.5/.5. I suspect this is because the energy required to change the participation inequality numbers is so large as to not be economical.</p>

<p>There are also some interesting interrelations between the numbers of people at the various levels of participation. Though discovering 100 new members has a good chance of adding 10 new participants, 1 of whom is very active, my experience has been that things trickle-down in the other direction as well: that adding 1 new high-level participant can lead to the creation of 9 medium-level participants and 90 lurkers (though don&#39;t let that suggest that all of your effort should be expended on the high-level participants only).</p>

<h3>Looking at Participation Inequality</h3>

<p>Here is a close look at four online communities, using the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/">quantcast.com</a> metrics service, where you can see some participation inequality in action:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3367609306/" title="Participation Inequality - quantcast.com by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img alt="Participation Inequality - quantcast.com" height="235" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3472/3367609306_023c85652f_o.jpg" width="961" /></a>

</p><p>From this you can see a typical online community site shows the normal 90% 9% 1% participation inequality. RPGnet shows a slightly better then average participation inequality due to its longevity and the quality of the community. ObesityHealth shows evidence of a great community with its 4% active participants, probably because you have to be very committed if you are going to have bariatric surgery. Last, an example of relatively&#0160;unhealthy&#0160;community that is unable to sustain its active participants.</p>

<p>You do have to be careful when analyzing quantcast numbers if you see active participants of greater then 6% — in almost all cases if you look deeper it is because there is some restriction that keeps people from lurking, either a fee or some other type of gateway, causing a distortion in the statistics.

</p><h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Multiple factors influence the success (or failure) or community. As we saw in my&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">first article</a>&#0160;on community numbers, the first factor is the&#0160;differing&#0160;group thresholds of community sizes. In my&#0160;<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">second article</a>, I show that&#0160;personal limits on the number of people you can have intimacy and trust with is an important factor. In this article I show that larger groups are subject to the power law of participation inequality, causing a small fraction of a community to be subject to group thresholds. In all three articles I show how expending energy can allow you to change the numbers, but with limits.</p><p>I hope this discussion of community numbers will give you some tools to look at the communities you are in, or are trying to build, and to better understand how to make them more successful.</p>

EXCERPT:
In my first article in this series I talked about community numbers: how the sizes of groups ultimately affect their success (or failure). However what I discussed only offers up the most rudimentary explanation of the dynamics, and that is because typically not all of the members of a group are equally involved. In order to better define who constitutes the tightly-knit "participant community" upon which the group thresholds act, we have to study power laws which let us measure the intensity of individuals' involvement in a group. (post continues with more details)

Having been the leader in several groups, I can truly relate to Participation Inequality.  Wow, it's tiring being the driving force behind a tremendous idea until it takes off.

It has been interesting to be part of a local blogging community and how it actually somewhat detracted from my overall bigger online community I was a part of before.  I seemed to have kept only the most dedicated readers (1%) from just simply joining a local group.

Chris - this was a really great series of 3 posts - it is outlined as well as anything I've seen on the subject.

In the course of your experience have you seen much of a difference between the style of content produced in communities and how that impacts the power law?  A few years ago I started a project to create an open source methodology for information management http://www.openmethodology.org, which worked in concert with corporate solutions also built in a collaborative fashion.  At least in this case, we have found the power law threshold to be even higher when creating a more structured, method-based approach to collaboration.  We did feel there was a need to put some controls in place for an "open method" and have experimented with different ways to build a collaborative commmunity.  Some good progress has been made, but its been tough going!

We also applied this same approach to sustainability http://www.open-sustainability.org.  Once again, very hard work to build the community but some slow steps are being made.

Do you have any thoughts around more structured collaboration and how it can negatively impact community growth in readership and contributions?  Any recommendations on ways to improve it?

BODY:
<p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html">previous</a> post, I talked about the limits on sizes of tightly-knit communities. These group limits are closely related to a number of interesting personal limits, and are often confused with them.</p>

<p>Unlike the group limits, personal limits actually measure something different: the number of connections that an individual can hold. They're yet another thing that you must consider when thinking about communities of people.</p>

<h3>Personal Limits</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3054773873/" title="Support Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3183/3054773873_07514d66dc_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Support Circle" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;"/></a><strong>The Support Circle:</strong> This is the number of individuals that you seek advice, support, or help from in times of severe emotional or financial stress. In most societies, the average size of an individual's Support Circle is 3-5. The people are the core of your intimate social network and most typically are also kin. In sociology papers this is often called the &quot;support clique&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563324/" title="Sympathy Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3055563324_f62dbcdc7d_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Sympathy Circle" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a><strong>The Sympathy Circle</strong>: This is larger then the Support Circle — it is the number of people that you go to for sympathy and also those people whose death would be devastating to you. The Sympathy Circle typically is in the range of 10-15 people, but can vary widely from as few as 7 to as many as 20. The Sympathy Circle often may be made up of kin, but usually includes some peers as well.</p>

<p>In sociology papers the Sympathy Circle is also known as a &quot;sympathy group&quot;, but I wanted to avoid the term &quot;group&quot;, as it is implies that all the members of a Sympathy Circle are connected. Instead, members of your Sympathy Circle will have additional people in their own Sympathy Circles that are not part of your own.</p>

<p>An interesting issue with the Sympathy Circle is that as a personal limit, 10-15 is a typical size. however, if you bring them all together in one place, they will likely become a <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/09/group-threshold.html#Judas_Number">Judas-Number-sized group</a>, with all of the problems associated with that size.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3055563798/" title="Trust Circle by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3055563798_5355b9b99c_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Trust Circle" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a><strong>The Trust Circle</strong>: These are the people that you have some type of intimate connection to. One study measured it as the people that you would send a family Christmas card to, while another simply tested emotional closeness.</p>

<p>In pre-Friendster days the Trust Circle would be those people that you considered your &quot;friends&quot;, however today the meaning of that term has begun to change. In my own usage, your Trust Circle are people that you have strong ties to and that in some measure you can trust. I have also called the Trust Circle your personal "intimate social network".</p>

<p>The size of different individuals' Trust Circles can vary widely (40-200), but <a href="http://delicious.com/christophera/trustcircle">some studies</a> show that the mean is on the low side of 150. This has led a number of researchers to compare this number with the Exclusive Dunbar Number of 150. However, I believe that this is a mistake; they are related, but in today's society members of your Trust Circle are rarely in the same mutual group.</p>

<p><strong>The Emotional Circle</strong></p>

<p> I personally define your Emotional Circle as the total number of people that you can have some type of non-mutual emotional connection with, most likely spread across numerous groups of all sorts. You &quot;like&quot; them in some way, but do not necessarily have to have strong ties to them.</p>

<p>In academia this threshold is called &quot;social channel capacity&quot;. A <a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/channel+capacity+christophermccarty">study</a> using two different methods to estimate, both suggest that it falls right around 290. However, I like to describe this number as &quot;just short of 300.&quot; As I wrote in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar Triage</a>, many people confuse this number with the Dunbar Number (and in fact I have in some of my older pieces). However, like the Trust Circle, it's a distinct entity.</p>

<p>Emotional Circle size can vary quite a bit from individual to individual. Some people might have half the average capacity, and others considerably more — which is much more variation than you see among the sizes of smaller personal thresholds.</p>

<p>Some of those variations are individual, but some are societal. As I wrote in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/07/cheers_belongin.html">Cheers: Belongingness and Para-Social Relationships</a>, I believe that our modern era of television causes us to create para-social relationships with imaginary characters who we nonetheless become emotionally involved with, and thus might reduce our social channel capacity.</p>

<p>Is our Emotional Circle smaller today because of TV or is it higher because online communities can help to remind us of our emotional connections to other people? That's a topic that probably deserves more study.</p>

<p>An interesting point to make is that the people who are in your Emotional Circle, but are not in your Trust Circle, are your &quot;weak ties&quot; in social network terms. What is important about weak ties is that <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/225469">studies show</a> (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf">pdf</a>) that opportunities and knowledge flow to you much more through weak ties than through the more insular strong ties of your trust circle.</p>

<p><strong>The Familiar Stranger</strong></p>

<p> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dlytle/2215047019/" title="Familar Strangers, from Blue Bottle Coffee Line by davitydave on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2125/2215047019_80e572fe0d_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Familiar Strangers" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>Outside of our Emotional Circle is a larger, more tenuous circle: those people whose faces you recognize, but who you know nothing more about. These are your &quot;Familiar Strangers&quot;.</p>

<p><a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/familiar+stranger">Studies show</a> that the percentage of familiar strangers in your vicinity has a real impact on your willingness to take risks. If you are in a new place with no one that you recognize, you'll avoid eye contact and will generally be unwilling to approach strangers. In a place where there are a lot of people that you've seen before (say in your favorite cafe, at a conference, or in the lunchroom of a large company), you'll be much more willing to take risks, such as asking questions, or sitting down next to someone to eat lunch.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to find any studies to show how many people that we can recognize, but for some people it is much larger than the number of people in your Emotional Circle, probably well over a thousand. However, there is also a lot more variance: some people are face-blind or near face-blind, and have a difficult time even recognizing friends.</p>

<p>There could also be some interesting research looking more closely at social network software. I find it fascinating that the professionally-oriented social network LinkedIn resisted supporting photos in profiles for so long yet ultimately failed, as well as how other social network software companies have attempted to require &quot;real&quot; photos of people rather then allowing "fakesters" or avatars.</p>

<h3>Crossing the Circles</h3>

<p>I've used the term &quot;circles&quot; throughout this article because it's a great metaphor for these levels of personal involvement. They can literally be thought of as concentric circles of people getting further and further away from an individual.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophera/3054729757/" title="Personal Circles Landscape by ChristopherA, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/3054729757_4fa37f7a6e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Personal Circles Landscape" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;"/></a>However, if you want to consider them with an even more graphic bent, think of these circles as the ridge lines of a topographical map. An individual sits at the center, and around him lie many other people, fading slowly away as the distance increases.</p>

<p>Winding through these topographical lines, like forests or rivers, are geographies of physical and emotional connection.</p>

<p>Kin are one of the most interesting geographies, because they lie all across the map. There's a clump of them in the innermost circles, but there are also many who lie in the realm of Familiar Strangers, including those cousins and great-aunts who you only see at family gatherings, and whom you know nothing about.</p>

<p>There are also forces being exerted upon the circles, acting like gravity to draw people together. They are the forces of trust, influence, and more. Their pulls are greatest toward the center, across your Circles of Support and Sympathy, but as people move farther away, these forces drop off quickly.</p>

</p>Thus, though I've described them as circles, with strict boundaries, we should also see these personal connections as fluid entities, a regular ecosytem of personal community.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Whereas the group thresholds that I discussed in my last article define the limits placed on community group size, the personal limits described herein instead define the limits placed on how many people an individual can know with various degrees of intimacy.</p>

<p>Perhaps there are societies where these two things might be the same. A true survival community might contain everyone a person knows, and thus he could draw out all his personal circles across that community canvas. However, in our modern era they're much more likely to be distinct, with an individual interacting with the members of his circles of acquaintances through numerous different group communities.</p>

<p>With this bifurcation of personal and group community limits, we have to briefly stop and ask a few questions. How do they relate? What can personal limits tell us about efficient community creation? Does founding a group upon a personal circle make its growth easier or harder? Conversely, what type of communities lead naturally to the creation of intimate circles?</p>

</p>Herein I've simply outlined personal thresholds as a contrast to group thresholds. The exploration of how these limits interact is worthy of additional studies.</p>

<p>In my next article &quot;Community by the Numbers, Part III: Power Laws&quot;, I will talk about how both group thresholds and personal thresholds have a role in larger, less tightly-knit groups.</p>

I like 'circles'; a very useful contrast to groups where the members are interconnected and know each other. I usually think of this as the difference between 'networks' and 'communities' on a larger scale. Looking forward to the next article about power laws across larger communities; in particular, I'm curious what you think the Dunbar number and other descriptions about group interaction and stability have to say about the dynamics of large groups with a shared identity (like enthusiasts in a large online community or 'offline' groups like labor unions, professional organizations or political parties).

The Information and findings about familiar strangers really inspired me a lot. I have the same experiences and I totally accept this point of view about feeling unsecured about taking risk at place where you have no familiar strangers.

I'm just getting started reading your blog (first two articles of the By The Numbers series), and I'm very interested.  A few random reactions so far:

- You speak of "circles", but you diagram spirals.  Would it be useful to recognize the differences and similarities?

- In "Bowling Alone", Robert Putnam speaks of two kinds of social capital: bonding (that holds groups together) and bridging (that relates a group to "others").  Would this distinction be useful in your model(s)?

- I've got a tentative start at a project intended to explore all aspects of communities, in particular the aspects that affect a community's health, resilience, and relationships to its environment (including other communities, of course).  See my URL from this comment.  I suspect I'll be referencing your work.

The different kind of 'circles' we have in the social networking are included in the reality friends we have now.The thing is, people don't really go out much now, but instead they are just trying to connect with these 'circles' we have in order to communicate. Some are really risking to go out beyond circles to explore. And this what social networking can do. Thanks, great read!

We often think of communities as organic creatures, which come into existence and grow on their own. However, the truth is they are fragile blossoms. Although many communities surely germinate and bloom on their own, purposefully creating communities can take a tremendous amount of hard work, and one factor their success ultimately depends upon is their <em>numbers</em>.</p>

<p>If a community is too small you'll often have insufficient critical mass to sustain it. Conversely, if it's too large you can end up with a community that's too noisy, too cliquey, or otherwise problematic. These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy.</p>

<p>We can analyze these community sizes in three ways. In this first article I'm going to talk about numerical group thresholds that have been observed in various sizes of tightly-knit communities, while in its sequel I'm going to talk about personal thresholds and how they relate to group thresholds. In my final post, I'm going to consider how power laws and inequalities of participation further complicate these simple values in the creation of larger communities. Together these three articles constitute what I call &quot;Community by the Numbers,&quot; a theory of community size.</p>

<p>Though I'm going to point to some studies which support these numbers, in general my goal here isn't to try and prove this theory of community size numbers, but rather to lay the theory out completely.</p>

<h3>Tightly-Knit Group Thresholds</h3>

<p>Groups can clearly exist at any size, from a partnership of two, on upward. However what I'm going to write about here are the threshold values: the ideal numbers where a community seems to function best, and the less than ideal numbers at which a community begins to grow unstable, remaining so until a new threshold number is reached.</p>

<p>I'm also specifically talking about groups that are both tightly-knit and participatory communities. Clearly Ford Motor Company, with 250,000 employees, doesn't match any of these group thresholds. But any self-contained community within Ford probably will (and in fact, it will probably be either a &quot;Working Group&quot; or a &quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Group&quot;, both terms I'll explain below). Similarly, a non-corporate community that doesn't <em>require</em> everyone to participate won't work quite the same as a community that does require participation from each member (though that's again the topic of the third article in this series).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.singers.com/jazz/group7.html"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/group7.jpg" title="Group7" alt="Group 7" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
<strong>7, &quot;The Working Group&quot;.</strong> <a name="Working_Group"></a>
This community size probably runs from about 4-9 members, but 7 is a pretty good average, and one that shows up in <a href="http://delicious.com/ChristopherA/workinggroup">multiple studies</a>. This number may well relate to the general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_seven">rule of seven</a> (<a href="http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/">original paper</a>), which suggests that 7 is a number that the brain can easily and intuitively comprehend.</p>

<p>It has become increasingly clear that a tightly-knit group of 7 is the first group size which is truly an optimal community size. Groups below this size can function effectively, but risk not having
enough manpower to deliver a result that everyone is happy with, or having insufficient viewpoints to avoid group think. </p>

<p>Seven is not only an optimal size for a wide variety of corporate and government committees, it is also a healthy size for a small business and even a good size for a party of close friends. More importantly, 7 is a very comfortable group size as it &quot;feels&quot; relatively natural. At this size members find it easy to get to know the other members of the group, and they're able to function well together in a very intuitive and organic fashion.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=560,height=403,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="143" border="0" alt="Squad and Fire Team" title="Squad and Fire Team" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/squadfireteam.gif" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
An interesting example of this group size is the modern infantry
&quot;squad&quot;, which consists of two fire teams of 4 people, and a squad
leader, for a total of 9 people. Each fire team is is large enough to
function on its own, but together the group of 9 can still have effective
small group dynamics.</p>

<p>It is typically at this size that the first signs of leadership in a group informally emerge, but the leadership usually isn't overbearing at this level, nor does there tend to be any rebellion against it — perhaps because the group may be too small to elicit multiple leaders.</p>

<p><strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper_(Leonardo)"><img width="200" height="109" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/lastsupper.jpg" title="Last Supper" alt="Last Supper" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a><a name="Judas_Number"></a>
13—&quot;The Judas Number&quot;.</em></strong> A group size of 13 doesn't represent a threshold ideal value, but rather a threshold nadir. It is one of the points where groups can change behavior and risk becoming dysfunctional. There's one of these nadirs beyond every group threshold, where the previously harmonious group dynamics become more difficult. I've chosen to highlight this specific number because it's a point that small communities often hit, particularly as entrepreneurial organizations try to grow above their startup beginnings.</p>

<p>(I should note that 13 isn't a precise number, but rather one offered because it's in the right range and because it's poetically easy to remember. The exact number occurs somewhere between 9 and 25, but I suspect it is worst in the range of 12-15.)</p>

<p>In a group of this community size no one ever feels like they get a fair share of time. Studies show that at this size participants underestimate the amount of time they contributed to the conversation, and thus will come out feeling like they were unfairly ignored despite having a fair share of the conversation. Groups of this size risk people being lumped into categories and ceasing to be trusted as individuals. In addition, problems start with the development of &quot;too many chiefs,&quot; yet there is not enough enough variety of non-chiefs for them to direct. Furthermore, multiple leaders may struggle for hierarchical status, increasing the conflict in an already troublesome group.</p>

<p>If your community is unfortunately stuck at this nadir, one of two things usually occurs.</p>

<p>Most commonly, the group shrinks. This could be because participants unhappy with the group dynamics abandon it; or it could occur in a more organized way with the unwieldy large group breaking into two or more smaller groups. For example, a terrible group of 13 could become two more functional groups of 6 and 7.</p>

<p>Alternatively, more energy could be expended. This could be in the form of more formal organization, rewards for participation, or more time to be casual and socialize in order to shake off the tensions of this size group. Though these efforts don't usually change the size of the group, they can improve its dynamics.</p>

<p>Energy could also be spent to help push the group up to the next threshold. Though this could occur naturally — for example if the group focuses on a topic of particular interest that causes new people to continually be added. In addition, in order to grow a group to a new threshold it often requires the efforts of more than one leader to succeed.</p>

<p>A group size of 13 isn't necessarily bad, just more difficult. Anthropological studies show that primitive hunting tribes often temporarily broke into &quot;bands&quot; of this size — my presumption is that the value of having that many people hunting together outweighed the social costs of the group. It is interesting that most juries are made up of groups this size. I believe that the social dynamics of this size of group with all new members creates some tension among the jurors, which may serve justice to make sure that all sides are considered by the jury without falling into groupthink. However, from my experience, the interpersonal conflict in a jury can also slow down the deliberation process and cause much frustration among the participants.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png"><img width="200" height="166" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/23/nonexclusivenetworks.png" title="Non-Exclusive Networks" alt="Non Exclusive Networks" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
50—&quot;The Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot;.</strong> <a name="Non-Exclusive_Dunbar_Number"></a>More properly this group size falls in the range of 25-75 participants, but it seems to feel the most natural in the range of 50-60. Studies of the sizes guilds in online games <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html">support</a> this hypothesis. For instance, based on graphs of the guild sizes in Ultima Online, groups have a median of 61 members. Similar numbers hold true in studies of a more recent game, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html">World of Warcraft</a>.</p>

<p>I call this value the &quot;Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot; because it matches the lower end of a threshold that <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Robin Dunbar</a> set for group sizes. However, at this size it applies to mostly non-exclusive groupings, which includes the above mentioned online guilds, many employee communities, and the majority of social gatherings that manage to rise above the size of a Working Group. Groups of this size <em>can</em> be serious or take up a lot of time, but in general they are not exclusive — they don't tend to be the only group that individual participants are involved in.</p>

<p><strong>90—&quot;The Dunbar Valley&quot;.</strong> As Non-Exclusive Dunbar Number communities grow, they reach a point where increased time obligations and the noise of socialization required to keep the group cohesive requires a much more serious commitment from the participants. Like the Judas Number, the Dunbar Valley is a threshold nadir where more energy is required to keep a tightly-knit community together;&nbsp; either the community agrees to a higher level of commitment and grows to the next level, or the community splits apart.</p>

<p>I've found this to be true when growing a small business — where it is too small for any middle-management, but the sub-groups are too large for one person to manage effectively. I've also seen this with more ephemeral groups, such as when a small conference that worked well at 60 participants tries to grow and finds at at 100 participants they can't sustain a high enough intimacy level.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=400,height=290,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg"><img width="200" height="145" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/legion_2.jpg" title="Roman Legion" alt="Roman Legion" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Another illustration of the Dunbar Valley is the history of the ancient Roman &quot;century&quot;, a grouping that was originally 100 soldiers. However, as the years went by, centuries tended to decrease in numbers to only include 70 or 80 soldiers. This might well be due to Non-Exclusive Dunbar constraints: even in a very devoted group of military men, there was still the need for relationships with other century groups, with support staff, and with camp followers, ultimately lowering the attention that could be spent on the century itself.</p>

<p><strong>150—&quot;The Exclusive Dunbar Number&quot;.</strong> Robin Dunbar got much of the discussion of group thresholds started with his <a href="http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/dunbar93coevolutionOf.html">article</a>, &quot;Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans.&quot; However, as I've written <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">previously</a>, and as I've described in this article, Dunbar's group threshold of 150 applies more to groups that are highly incentivized and relatively exclusive and whose goal is survival.</p>

<p>Dunbar makes this obvious by the statement that such a grouping &quot;would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.&quot; </p>

<p> The result of the grooming requirement is that communities bounded by the Exclusive Dunbar Number are relatively few. You will find hunter/gatherer and other subsistence societies where this is a natural tribe size. You'll also find these groups sizes in <a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2004/03/what_is_the_opt.html">terrorist and mafia</a> organizations. </p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=430,height=279,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg"><img width="200" height="129" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2008/09/22/sopranos_dinner.jpg" title="The Sopranos at Dinner" alt="The Sopranos at Dinner" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Clearly, as we step up toward higher group thresholds, more and more
time is required to simply keep the group going. You see this in
depictions of mafia life — in the TV series <em>The Sopranos</em> a lot of time
is spent dining, hanging out, and drinking together. That is part of that 42% social
grooming time required for that intense of a survival group.</p>

<p>It is possible for a large company to force groups up to this size by expending lots of energy (which is to say money) to keep it healthy. Apple did this during the invention of the Macintosh, the first OS X operating system, and the iPhone, but the intensity required of such large teams is not sustainable for long periods of time.</p>

<p>Without that extra energy, few modern tightly-knit communities can reach this threshold, or else can't hold it for very long. Instead they fracture into groups of individual interest (even if they continue to &quot;meet&quot; in the same real-world or online forum), which are more than more likely to be bounded by the Non-Exclusive Dunbar number.</p>

<p>Given the difficulty in even arriving at the Exclusive Dunbar number, it may well be the highest limit of all for a tightly-knit community. Beyond this limit, communities are less cohesive, less trusted, and less participatory (and the topic of my third article in this series.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are many different ways to measure groups, and one is by counting its members. As I've discussed here, the number of members can have a huge impact on whether the communities are successful or not. Thus, as community organizers, social software engineers, game designers, or as sociologists interested in community dynamics, we must ultimately consider group thresholds and group nadirs; to understand how to create cohesive communities, rather than groups that fly apart.</p>

<p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2008/11/personal-circle.html">next article</a> I'm going to talk about thresholds that are personal, rather then group-oriented.</p>

This view of group size dynamics has a lot of potential implications for all kinds of things including management science and more specifically/interesting to me startup dynamics. Namely, you're proposing an outline that can be mapped to company size and funding levels, amounts of management required/deployable etc. Have you thought of making a stronger connection in this area?

Reading :

"These optimal and sub-optimal community sizes appear in strata, like discrete layers of rock. For a community to advance from one strata to the next often takes immense energy."

Reminds me of Quantum states of Electrons spinning around the nucleus. So, maybe different quantic numbers of persons generate different energy levels, apt for different services?

Also as an analogy, if I recall well, when coming from an external path to an internal one allows the matter to shed light. So, maybe as we internalize we allow light to reach outward?

BODY:
<p>This blog has been quiet lately as I've been doing a lot of work in the last year on the iPhone. I've been speaking at conferences like eComm 2008 (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/eComm2008/christopher-allens-presentation-at-ecomm-2008">presentation</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nmscommunications.com/communications/2008/05/heres-the-compl.html">video from panel</a>), writing an book on the iPhone with my co-author Shannon Appelcline called <a href="http://www.manning.com/callen">iPhone in Action: Introduction to Web and SDK Development</a> (first <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/callen/callen_meapch1-2.pdf">two chapters</a> free</a>), and I am one of the organizers for the upcoming <a href="http://www.iPhoneDevCamp.org">iPhoneDevCamp 2</a>, a MacHack style conference on August 1st-3rd, and I am working on some social software apps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>I've been reluctant to post too many of these off posts on this blog, as I like the length, quality and high-signal-to-noise ratio of the posts that I've written for this blog. I do plan to continue to offer more social software and social media posts, including followups to my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">Collective Choice</a> articles, as well as updates on my popular <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> posts.

In an effort to minimize or reduce this level of uncertainty, strict rules, laws, policies, and regulations are adopted and implemented. The ultimate goal of this population is to control everything in order to eliminate or avoid the unexpected. As a result of this high Uncertainty Avoidance characteristic, the society does not readily accept change and is very risk adverse.</blockquote></p>

A low ranking in the Uncertainty Avoidance Dimension is indicative of a society that has fewer rules and does not attempt to control all outcomes and results. It also has a greater level of tolerance for a variety of ideas, thoughts, and beliefs.</blockquote></p>

<p>My presentation is an offshoot of an odd sideline of mine, executive blog and social web coaching. Basically, many times over the last couple of years I've been asked by colleagues and friends to help them with the social web. I've always been honored to spend the time to teach them how to blog, better manage the noise of the web by using a feed reader, how to participate in social networks, and how to improve their personal brand.</p>

<p>Increasingly, the social network of their peers is now asking me to help them to do the same for them. So I've been doing this more and more over the last year on a consulting basis as their social networks appear to be saying saying that I have a lot to offer.</p>

<p>I've twice now been out to Cincinnati where I've been working with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/5/3a9/480">Drew Boyd</a> at Johnson & Johnson, where I've been coaching him on his blog and personal brand. He has been blogging now for almost six months at <a href="http://www.innovationinpractice.com/">Innovation in Practice</a> with some success. Now he is referring me to other executives at Johnson & Johnson who need similar coaching, or need strategic advice on how to deal with specific social web initiatives within Johnson & Johnson.</p>

<p>Most recently, Drew has asked me to join him in Seoul to speak at the Global Forum, which is a worldwide gathering of executive trainers. There I am presenting a synopsis of what I teach, and how they can begin to learn how to teach their staff how to do the same. My trip has been sponsored by Johnson & Johnson, so it has been a lot of fun to be here. I get to both dive into deep discussions of methodologies for teaching inside business, as well as learn about the Korean and other international business cultures and how they are different from the United States.</p>

<p>During the evenings I've had a chance to wander the streets of downtown Seoul. It is very different then wandering though streets in Europe, not only because of the different culture and language, but also because all of the signs are in Hangul, the korean character set. Very few signs use the roman alphabet, so it is often very difficult to figure out what is what without walking in. Like Japan, there are some signs in English to represent a brand or a style, but not many. Even China has more signs in English then Korean's do -- the last time I was there I was surprised by how almost every important sign was in both Chinese and English, so much so I was beginning to learn Chinese language characters just by association! Despite the language problems everyone is nice and it feels safe to wander in these neighborhoods.</p>

<p>I return on Monday, and I'll make a copy of my final presentation available here.</p>

Over 380 iPhone developers came out to the Adobe Campus in San Francisco to help each other make the best possible web pages and webapps for the iPhone.</p>

<p>I was the keynote speaker on Saturday and Master of Ceremonies for the MacHack-style <a href="http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCampHackAThon">Hack-a-Thon Demo</a> on Sunday.</p>

<p>At the Hack-a-Thon almost 50 iPhone web applications were demonstrated to an enthusiastic audience. Take a look at <a href="http://www.xeodesign.com/tilt">Tilt</a>, a game that takes advantage of the iPhone's motion sensor, <a href="http://www.mxis.com/pickleview">PickleView</a>, which is a same-time live baseball game enhancer, and <a href="http://www.bartholo.com/devcamp/pool.html">The Pool</a>, an attractive social game of water droplets hitting a pool. What is remarkable about these applications is not just the quality, but that each of them was written over just the weekend by a small team of 3-4 people who hadn't met each other before Friday!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/snackfight/750214294/"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2007/07/08/hewitt.jpg" title="Hewitt" alt="Hewitt" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> Prizes were awarded after the Hack-a-Thon based on the spirit of openness, contribution, sharing, and participation. Prizes included 3 iPhones and some very expensive Adobe software. In particular <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a>, of <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> fame, was honored for his positive contributions, generous spirit, and wonderful iPhone UI <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/files/iphone/navigation.html">example code</a>. During the demonstrations, more than one person praised Joe, saying that his assistance, his code, or his debugger made their apps possible. Personally, I think about one-third of the web apps presented used some of his code.</p>

<p>Building on my experience with the same-time collaboration tool <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>, and the <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> web-based games, I worked remotely with <a href="http://www.kallealm.com/">Kalle</a> from Sweden and <a href="http://is-here.com/">Erwin</a> from Kansas to present an AJAX chat application called <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/">iLace</a>. I am particularly proud of how well this little web application performs and how well it works using the iPhone UI. In particular, I think its melding of text entry and chat message receipt and its response to changes between portrait and landscape modes are very good examples of what can be done for chat on the iPhone. Source code is <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com/ilace/about.html">available</a>!</p>

I'm told a live recording of the session and an .mp3 will be available soon.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks an online developer community that I started at WWDC called <a href="http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com">iPhoneWebDev</a> has grown to over 650 members. It's now the best place to get online support for building iPhone web pages and webapps. I'd like to keep the momentum from the iPhoneDevCamp going forward on this list, so if you are interested in developing for the iPhone, check out the <a href="http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/examples">example code</a> and <a href="http://www.iphonewebdev.com/">join</a> the discussion today!</p>

I've been excited about the web capabilities of the upcoming <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> for some time. As a reluctant laptop user (&quot;oh, my aching shoulders&quot;), there is real appeal to me in a better portable web browser. I have tried most of the PDA and cellphone browsers to date, and none offer more then a poor cousin to the web that we experience on the desktop.</p>

<p>Instead, the iPhone offers a desktop-class browser. There is no transcoding, nor any subset of HTML such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language">WML</a>. Full web pages are rendered in the small display, and when you &quot;double-tap&quot; with your finger the section you touch is expanded to a more readable size. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/ads/ad4/">video</a> available at the Apple website shows this capability in use.</p>

<p>Because of the iPhone's upcoming July 29th release, I decided to participate in this week's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple WWDC</a> conference for Macintosh developers. There a number of announcements about the iPhone were released, and a number of technical sessions on the iPhone and iPhone-related technologies were held. Together the iPhone demonstrations at the public keynote and other demonstrations throughout the WWDC offered some real promise for when the phone is released on June 29th.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=440,height=292,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/06/15/iphonesteve.jpg"><img width="200" height="132" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/2007/06/15/iphonesteve.jpg" title="Iphonesteve" alt="Iphonesteve" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
The biggest announcement at the public <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/d7625zs/event/">keynote</a> was that there will not be an SDK for building native iPhone apps; instead, the only way for third parties to get involved is to create web applications optimized for the iPhone. This came as a big disappointment to the majority of developers participating at WWDC. However, as someone who has been involved lately in creating AJAX/Web 2.0 apps, I was less unhappy.</p>

<p>The other significant announcement at the keynote was that a <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Safari 3.0 beta</a> for both Mac and Windows was being released and that a third Safari platform would be released on July 29th—inside the iPhone. This means that web 2.0 applications created to work with Safari on the Mac will likely also work on the iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.synchroedit.com"><img border="0" alt="SynchroEdit" title="SynchroEdit" src="http://www.synchroedit.com/img/selogo-nobox-green.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Since <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>, an open-source simultaneous web editor (in the style of <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a>) for Firefox that I produced last year, is one of the most sophisticated AJAX/Web 2.0 applications, I dug deeper at various WWDC sessions to see if it might be possible to make SynchroEdit work on the iPhone.</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that SynchroEdit needs in order to function is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-mutationevents">DOM Mutation Events</a>. At a party for <a href="http://www.webkit.org">WebKit</a> (the open source code underpinnings of Safari's web renderer) and in questions after a session at WWDC it was confirmed that these are available to Safari 3.0 and presumably the iPhone.</p>

<p>The other key ability that SynchroEdit requires is WYSIWYG editing. This was terribly broken in Safari 2.0, but I saw many demonstrations of it working in Safari 3.0, so I don't anticipate any problems with this.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit also requires AJAX and in particular the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XMLHttpRequest</a> function, and the keynote clearly said that this was available.</p>

<p>The final thing that SynchroEdit needs is the ability to keep the browser at <em>readystate==3</em>, i.e. not &quot;finish&quot; sending the page, so that we can continue to interactively pass updates to users as they arrive, without creating a new connection for every message. It is not clear if this will be supported on the iPhone, but there are ways to work around it.</p>

<p>So, in principle, it appears that we should be able to make SynchoEdit work on the iPhone. I am not sure that many iPhone users need SynchroEdit, but as an example of a very sophisticated web technology that should work on that platform, it shows the potential for what might be possible.</p>

<p>Because of this technological capability I've decided to begin investigating what type of social software apps could be highly useful on the iPhone and that aren't being served by the existing web 2.0 community. I am also going to continue investigating the technical issues of developing web apps for the iPhone</p>

<p>If you are interested as well, I invite you to participate in the new <a href="http://www.iPhoneWebDev.com/">iPhoneWebDev</a> community. It should be a great resource for everyone interested in getting in on the ground floor with this new web technology. I have also begun tagging relevant web pages in <a href="http://del.icio.us/ChristopherA">del.icio.us</a> with the tag <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/iphonewebdev">iphonewebdev</a>—I hope that others will begin to use this tag as well.</p>

<p>I have quite a bit more I'd like to write about specific iPhone technology, but unfortunately I have to wait until the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/attendee/">WWDC confidentiality</a> expires on June 29th with the release of the iPhone, so keep an eye out here for more details.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em>[This is the fourth in a series of articles on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline">Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml">jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml">Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>Last year in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">Collective Choice: Rating Systems</a> we took a careful look at eBay and other websites that collect ratings, and used those systems as examples to highlight a number of theories about how to make rating systems more useful.</p>

<p>We suggested three main methods for improving rating systems:</p>

<p><strong>Granular Ratings:</strong> Based on the clumping of ratings to high values, we believed that ratings could be made more useful by increasing the size of a rating scale. Most rating scales are 5-point ranges, so we suggested a 10-point range instead.</p>

<p><strong>Distinct Ratings:</strong> Raters can be somewhat arbitrary in how they rate items, varying both from each other and even from themselves (usually over multiple sessions). Thus we believed that providing explicit statements of what each number meant could improve ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Ratings:</strong> Finally we stated that in low volumes ratings could be biased by various quirks of data entry, either malevolent or not, and that ratings could be improved with strong statistical methods being used to polish up data and automatically keep &quot;bad&quot; data in line with &quot;good&quot;.</p>

<p>In the year since we wrote that article we've decided to practice what we preach and have rolled out an entirely new rating system called <a href="http://index.rpg.net">The RPGnet Gaming Index</a>. We've applied all of the above theories and thus far it looks like they're not only working, but that they're actually providing better rating systems than previous ones we've used at the RPGnet site.</p>

<p>In this article we're going to step through the data we've collected from this experience and see how it applies to our theory: first by looking at our previous RPGnet rating system, then by looking at the new system, and finally by by examining the data from these two systems and comparing their results. We've also run into some unexpected troubles along the way, and we'll talk about that too.</p>

<h3>The RPGnet Reviews System</h3>

RPGnet is our gaming site for tabletop roleplaying—games like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>. We purchased it in 2001 from the original owners. One of the benefits of RPGnet was that it had a very large community. As of today it sports one of the top-100 forums on the Internet, with over 1000 simultaneous users regularly logging in. However, because of its maturity, we also inherited many existing systems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml"><img border="0" alt="Rpgnet_review_summary_1" title="Rpgnet_review_summary_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/rpgnet_review_summary_1.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
One of these was the <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/">RPGnet Reviews System</a> which gave individual users the ability to review gaming products—mostly role-playing games, but also board games, books, DVDs, and a smattering of related products.</p>

<p>Most of these reviews are submitted by average readers who just want to talk about a product that they like (or don't), though a fair percentage are instead submitted by staff reviewers. (Overall at least 26% of our reviews are based on publisher &quot;comp&quot; copies, and thus may be considered largely professional, while the other 74% may or may not be.) The large community size of RPGnet applies to the Reviews System as well: currently it features 8,505 published reviews.</p>

<p>Looking at the RPGnet Reviews through our three filters we find the following:</p>

<p><strong>Granularity.</strong> The ratings from our existing reviews aren't as granular as we'd like. We have a theoretical scale of 2-10, but that's based upon a Style rating of 1-5 and a Substance rating of 1-5.</p>

<table cellpadding="5">

</tbody></table>

<p> Approximately 90% of raters rate only with values of 3-5, and thus our scale is more limited than the 2-10 range would indicate. 42.9% of reviews further rate Style and Substance exactly the same, suggesting that not everyone sees a difference between these two elements. On the whole this scale isn't as a bad as a singular 5-point scale, but it also isn't a real 10-point scale, and the two orthogonal types of comparison don't necessarily provide a coherent description of a product.</p>

<p><strong>Distinctiveness.</strong> Conversely, the review ratings are fairly distinct because the Review System provides an explanation of what each rating number means. For example the five Substance ratings are: I Wasted My Money (1); Sparse (2); Average (3); Meaty (4); Excellent(5). The descriptions could be better, but hopefully they connect to some users in meaningful ways, and help them to rate consistently.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Our review ratings have no statistical basis. These values are used entirely unfiltered.</p>

<p>On the whole, the existing RPGnet Reviews embodied slightly less than half of what we wanted to see in a rating systems: some improvement over a simple 5-point scale; some effort put into making individual ratings distinct; and nothing statistical.</p>

<p>There is room for improvement, however, as we'll see when we analyze this system more fully.</p>

<h3>The RPGnet Gaming Index</h3>

<p>Our newer system is the <a href="http://index.rpg.net/">RPGnet Gaming Index</a>. It doesn't supersede our Reviews, but instead offers a complementary look at the roleplaying field. The Index is essentially an RPG industry database. It contains individual entries for many different gamebooks—currently 5248—and allows registered users to rate each of them. Those ratings are then turned into averages by various mathematical formulas on a nightly basis and the roleplaying games in our index are then ranked.</p>

<p>The large size of RPGnet has allowed us to very quickly turn our ideas of a Gaming Index into reality. Just six months after release we have:</p>

<ul><li>5248 well-written Index entries </li>
<li> 5908 different editions</li>
<li> 4240 authors</li>
<li> 4478 covers</li>
<li> 360 different game systems</li>
<li> 345 series</li>
<li> 10142 individual ratings</li></ul>

<p>Most of the ratings are clumped around the best and worst games, with many less popular games unrated as of yet. Four different items have at least 80 ratings each (<em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, <em>Exalted</em>, <em>Nobilis</em>, and <em>Unknown Armies</em>). Our average rating is 6.79. Ratings above 7.82 are in the 99th
percentile, ratings above 7.21 are in the 90th percentile, and ratings
below 6.53 are beneath the 10th percentile.</p>

<p>(For more info on the creation of the RPG Index, and how to encourage user generated content, see Shannon's articles, &quot;Managing User Creativity&quot;, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_192.phtml">Part One</a> and <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_193.phtml">Part Two</a>.) </p>

<p>The RPGnet Index also handles some unusual situations, such as when a game book contains other game books as part of an anthology or compilation. For instance, the 8-book compilation <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry.phtml?mainid=64">In Search of Adventure</a> has a composite rating of <a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry-ratings.phtml?mainid=64">6.57</a> which is partially based upon the individual adventures that make it up.</p>

<p><strong>Granularity:</strong> The first thing we did was provide a 10-point scale for this new system.</p>

<p><strong>Distinctiveness:</strong> We also made sure each point of the scale was clearly defined. Currently the points of our scale are: Worthless (1), Poor (2), Some Flaws (3), Almost Average (4), Average (5), Above Average (6), Good (7), Very Good (8), Outstanding (9), and One of the Best Ever (10).</p>

<p>We made some mistakes in our original release of our &quot;distinctive&quot; titles, and we discovered this had real effects on the user input, telling us that these title labels <em>are</em> meaningful to users.</p>

<p>First, we initially labeled 6 as &quot;average&quot;, to mirror the rating system for our existing Reviews, rather than setting 5 to be average. But as we noted in our first article, people like to be nice, and thus they tend to rate on the good side of a scale. Changing the label for our definition of average from 6 to 5 has slowly started dropping the average of all ratings down as a result (providing more breadth, a topic we'll talk about more shortly).</p>

<p>Second, two of our original distinctive titles were at odds with the others. Our original &quot;2&quot; value said that the game had &quot;a few useful elements&quot; and our original &quot;9&quot; value said that it was the &quot;best of the year&quot;. The 2 was much more specific than any of our other terms and the 9 created a comparative query that was very different from anything else. Overall our ratings conformed to a bell curve centered between 6 and 7, but we saw very clear dropouts in our curve at 2 and 9, telling us that we'd made mistakes in those terms, and that people were less willing to use them as a result. Since we've made the change to our current set of titles those two discontinuities have disappeared.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics.</strong> Finally, we fully integrated statistics into our new Index by using two main methods: bayesian weights and trust.</p>

<p>We explained bayesian weights pretty fully in our previous article. Here's what we said then:</p>

<blockquote>
<table width="90%" border="1" cellpading="3"><tbody><tr><p>
The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]</code></p>

<p>r = average rating for an item</p>

<p>W(r) = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings</p>

<p>a = average rating for your collection</p>

<p>W(a) = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item</p>

<p>b(r) = new bayesian rating </p>

<p>Say three &quot;shill&quot; users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a &quot;10&quot; because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:</p>

<p><code>
b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)</code><code><br />b(r) = 680 / 103</code><code><br />b(r) = 6.60
</code>
</p></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>We implemented bayesian weights exactly as we'd detailed, but with a lower weight of 25. Since then we've accrued over 10,000 ratings in the database, and we can probably start thinking about cranking that weight up, another topic we'll return to.</p>

<p>Our trust-based algorithms suggest that some ratings are better than others, and should thus be more trusted (and thus more weighted when we calculate the average rating of an item). Though bayesian weights have been used before, we're not aware of other systems that weight ratings based on trust. </p>

<p>The calculation of trust is very simple:</p>

<p><code>
Weight = 0 if #ratings(user) &lt;= 2</code><code><br />Otherwise Weight = #ratings(user) / 50 to a maximum of 2</code><code><br />Weight *= 2, to a maximum of 4, if the user included a comment
</code>

</p>

<p>This was based on the idea that the average good rater would rate 25 different items and the average great rater would rate at least 50. Additionally, we believed that ratings with comments were more likely to be thoughtful than those without.</p>

<p>That, overall, is a quick picture of what we've done with the RPGnet Gaming Index. Some of these ideas were laid out from the start, and others have been tuned as we progressed. </p>

<p>So how did we do, particularly in comparison to our existing RPGnet Reviews System?</p>



<h3>The Comparison</h3>

<p>One of our goals in improving rating systems has been to widen the range of possible input. As we noted earlier we discovered that 90% of our RPGnet Reviews Ratings were in the 3-5 range, and only 10% in the 1-2 range.</p>

<p>Generally, we can measure the success of widening a range by seeing whether the average rating of a database moves toward the <em>true</em> average. For the purposes of a 10-point scale from 1-10, that's a desired value of 5.5. That generally means we're looking for our average rating to <em>decrease</em> because people tend to rate high.</p>

<p>The following table compares the average results of Reviews ratings and Index ratings.</p>

<center><table cellpadding="3" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Database</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Converted Reviews</strong></td>

<td>7.25</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Massaged Reviews</strong></td>

<td>7.29</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Unweighted Index</strong></td>

<td>7.10</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Weighted Index</strong></td>

<td>6.78</td></tr>
</tbody></table></center>

<p>Here's what the categories in the above chart represent:</p>

<p><strong>Converted Reviews:</strong> The Style + Substance of the Reviews, converted from its 2-10 scale to a 1-10 scale: </p>

<p><code>
$rating = avg($style) + avg($substance);</code><br /><code>$rating = ($rating * 1.125) - 1.25;
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Massaged Reviews:</strong> The Style + Substance of the Reviews, with Substance given double weight over Style because we think that more closely reflects the intentions of the reviewer, converted from its 2-10 scale to a 1-10 scale:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = (average($style) + 2*average($substance))/1.5;</code><br /><code>$rating = ($rating * 1.125) - 1.25;
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Unweighted Index:</strong> Index ratings exactly as users have entered into our Gaming Index:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = average($index-rating);
</code>

</p>

<p><strong>Weighted Index:</strong> Index ratings adjusted by the weight of each individual rating, which is based on user trust and inclusion of comments:</p>

<p><code>
$rating = average($index-rating*$index-weight)/average($index-weight);
</code>

</p>

<p>Our average rating—which is our criteria for success—decreased somewhat from the Reviews System to the Gaming Index and it decreased much more dramatically when we introduced our trust systems.</p>

<p>The following chart shows the a typical example of how review and index ratings differ, using the venerable <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player's Handbook</em> as an example:</p>

<center><a href="http://index.rpg.net/display-entry-ratings.phtml?mainid=72"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only.jpg" title="Dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only" alt="Dd_players_handbook_rpgnet_reviews_only" /><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only.jpg" title="Dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only" alt="Dd_players_handbook_index_ratings_only" /></a></center><p>For this book the median ratings from reviews-only is 8, and the median from index-only is 7. A one-to-two point drop in median rating from reviews to index was consistent in all of our most-rated games other than those which were a rated a &quot;10&quot; in both places.</p>

<p>We believe that this initial success of our unweighted Gaming Index can be attributed to the slightly better <em>granularity</em>—a 10-point scale versus two 5-point scales—and our improved <em>distinctiviness</em>—based on better naming of the rating levels. The veracity of this will ultimately be played out as the Index grows.</p>

<p>However we have no doubt that our <em>statistical</em> approach to the index data, when we moved from our unweighted Index to our weighted Index, is providing even better results. We had theorized that users who input more and who include comments would provide &quot;better&quot; data, and by our criteria of the average of the ratings moving toward 5.5 that seems to be borne out. The following table looks at the information a bit more precisely, by comparing average ratings as total number of ratings increases over several ranges:</p>

<center><table cellpadding="3" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong># of Ratings</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average w/Comment</strong></td>

<td><strong>Average w/o Comment</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>1-2</strong></td>

<td>8.55</td>

<td>8.88</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>3-24</strong></td>

<td>8.08</td>

<td>8.16</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>25-49</strong></td>

<td>7.32</td>

<td>7.11</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>50-99</strong></td>

<td>7.14</td>

<td>7.03</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>100+</strong></td>

<td>6.17</td>

<td>6.99</td></tr></tbody></table></center>

<p>This table fairly definitively shows that base maxim: that the breadth of the ratings, and thus their quality, increases the more ratings a user makes. The improved quality of ratings with comments is less definitive. Among the vast mass of users the two values are pretty close, and sometimes the reverse of what we expect, but for the best and the worst users, ratings with comments seem to be better than those without. This latter point is another one that we'll have to continue to monitor as the Index grows beyond its current total of 10,000 ratings.</p>

<p>The other major element of our <em>statistical</em> approach to the Index is our bayesian weight. The following chart shows a top-ten chart for roleplaying games calculated via four different methodologies: our Reviews; our Index with no weighting; our Index with a 25 bayesian weighting (as it currently stands); and our Index with a 50 bayesian weighting:</p>

<center><table cellpadding="3" border="1"><tbody><tr><td><strong>#</strong></td>

<p>We actually <em>did</em> do a little bit of statistical analysis on the Reviews because on our first try to produce this chart we got a random clump of reviews that were 5/5 from a much larger pool, so we further ordered them by descending total count of reviews, and as a result you're seeing a better selection of ranked reviews than a truly unstatistical sampling would allow. We did the same for the unweighted Index (which clumped a number of results at &quot;10&quot;), except we further ordered items at the same weight by decreasing number of views (another statistical decision).</p>

<p>Clearly, deciding which of these lists is &quot;right&quot; is a much more subjective measure than the mathematical analysis we were able to apply to earlier problems. However, most roleplayers would tell you that the unweighted Reviews and Index lists are terrible. The top 5 items in the Reviews list actually aren't bad for a starting list of good games—but only because we did the aforementioned statistical ordering. Before that we just had a random listing of gaming items. Even with our attempts at quickie statistical analysis the unweighted Index is still quite bad, with only <em>Talislanta</em> regularly showing up on other &quot;best&quot; lists.</p>

<p>The problem is the ability of one person to come in and rate an item a &quot;10&quot; (or a &quot;5&quot;/&quot;5&quot;), thereby making that item more highly rated than <em>any</em> item which has an actual consensus of ratings. Of our unweighted top Reviews only the top three had more than 2 reviews and the rest had 2. Not surprisingly those top three were the best fits to a typical top-ten list. Of the unweighted Index only the top three had more than 1 rating, and the rest had 1. Our single good pick was in those top three.</p>

<p>Our 25-weight Index, which is what we currently use, has been generally accepted by the RPGnet community as a good marker of what's good and what's not. However there have been two items on it which some percentage of people disagree with: <em>Spirit of the Century</em> and <em>Pulp Hero</em>. It's instructive to see that when we increase to a 50-weight Index <em>Spirit of the Century</em> drops (even more notably than depicted here, because its actual rating changes from .01 from first place to .16 from first place) and <em>Pulp Hero</em> disappears entirely.</p>

<p>The questions of <em>what</em> to set your bayesian weight to, when to increase it, and what maximum value to set it to are all relatively unstudied and thus we don't have good answers to them. As we pass 10,000 ratings we're considering upping the bayesian value to 50. We expect that 100 will be our ultimate value when the Index is fully mature, however if we increase the weight too far an older, less rated game will never be able to get enough weight to get out of the doldrums.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We're by no means done with this ratings experiment. Though we've pleased and impressed with the growth of the RPGnet Index thus far, by next year we hope that the Index will include the vast majority of all games in print (as opposed to somewhat less than half now) and that our 10,000 ratings will grow to 50,000 or more. This will allow us to offer even more definitive answers to our questions.</p>

<p>In the meantime we're still mucking with our statistics and facing new problems.&nbsp; Some of the newest:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What to do about drive-by ratings:</strong> Our trust algorithm does a good job of making drive-by ratings, where a publisher points his audience to an item in our site, mostly irrelevant, but there's some concern that they could have more effect in the long run.</li>

<li><strong>How to incorporate our review ratings in our index ratings:</strong> It seems a shame to waste the thousands of reviews that have been written—and indeed currently they're calculated into a composite rating we use in the Index—but we're realizing that people have very different purposes for writing reviews and inputing ratings, which may result in some of the upward skew we see on the review side of things. Ultimately we need to decide whether they're just too different or whether our statistical massaging is enough to incorporate those reviews into a composite Index rating.</li>

<li><strong>How to pick some of our numbers:</strong> As we already noted we don't have good formulas for when to choose which bayesian weights. Likewise we've been guessing at which values to use for the trust-based weighting of our raters. Originally we set our desired rating count to 100 for good rater and 200 for great raters, but we've since dropped those to 50 for good and 100 for great based upon the real numbers of ratings that users were making. Again, we'd prefer to derive an actual formula for this type of calculation</li></ul>

<p>Shannon has discussed some of these issues more in his recent article <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_198.phtml">More Thoughts Abour Ratings</a>.</p>

<p>Despite unanswered questions, we still feel good about the basic ideas we laid out in our article last year. We have no doubt that giving our ratings a <em>statistical</em> basis has dramatically improved them and evidence thus far suggests that both <em>granularity</em> and <em>distinctiveness</em> have been helpful as well.<br />

EXCERPT:
Last year in Collective Choice: Rating Systems we took a careful look at eBay and other websites that collect ratings, and used those systems as examples to highlight a number of theories about how to make rating systems more useful.

In the year since we wrote that article we've decided to practice what we preach and have rolled out an entirely new rating system called The RPGnet Gaming Index. We've applied all of the above theories and thus far it looks like they're not only working, but that they're actually providing better rating systems than previous ones we've used at the RPGnet site.

In this article we're going to step through the data we've collected from this experience and see how it applies to our theory: first by looking at our previous RPGnet rating system, then by looking at the new system, and finally by by examining the data from these two systems and comparing their results. We've also run into some unexpected troubles along the way, and we'll talk about that too. (post continues with a detailed analysis...)

0-10 scale is too large for most relevant human ratings systems. maybe i should pull the psych papers, but people tend to do a 1-5 or 0-5 scale better. it's a sign of immaturity to only use the endpoints.

<p>My colleague, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline.php">Shannon Appelcline</a>, has been working on a game rating system for <a href="http://www.rpg.net">RPGnet</a>. This has resulted in real-world application of the principles for designing rating systems which we've previously discussed in our <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">Collective Choice</a> articles. Shannon's newest article, <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_196.phtml">Ratings,
Who Do You Trust?</a> offers a look at weighting ratings based on reliability.</p>

<p><em>Here's how we measured each type of trust, and what we did about it:</em></p>

<ul><li><p><em><strong>Volume of Ratings for an Item.</strong> Introduce a bayesian weight to offset the variability of items with low-volume ratings.</em></p></li>

<li><p><em><strong>Volume of Ratings by a User.</strong> Give each user a weight based on his volume of contribution which is applied to his ratings.</em></p>
</li>

<li><p><em><strong>Depth of Content by a User.</strong> Give each rating a weight based on the depth of thought implicit in the rating which is applied to that rating.</em></p>
</li></ul>

<p><em>These all get put together to create our final ratings for
the Gaming Index, with each user's individual rating for an item
getting multiplied by its user weight and its content weight, and then
all of that averaged with the other user ratings and the bayesian
weight too. The result is in no way intuitive, but users don't really
need to understand the back end of a rating system. Conversely we hope
it's accurate, or at least more accurate than would otherwise be true
given the relatively low volume of ratings we've collected thus far.</em></p>

Hmm, interesting on the weighting system.

Can you explain with more detail how the rating by depth of content is generated?

I'm looking through the other articles, so hopefully I find the info there.

My first pass system just used a different multiplier for weight based on the type of content:

1x for just a raw rating
2x for a rating with a non-blank comment
5x for a review (which goes through a different, approved content system)

My second pass system also included "volume of ratings by user" and thus applied a variable multiplier depending on how many ratings the user has made:

(0-2x) for a raw rating
2x(0-2x) for a rating with comment
5x for a review

The 0-2x is calculated as (# of ratings by user)/50, to 2 max.

I'm pretty sure that the core weighting system by depth is producing better results, though I haven't done any studies of that yet. The additional weighting for volume by users has definitely prevented bias by hit-and-run raters who just stop by to rate one game that they've been asked to.

<p>In <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">Collective Choice: Rating Systems</a> I discuss ratings scales of various sorts, from eBay's 3-point scale to RPGnet's double 5-point scale, and BoardGame Geek's 10-point scale.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif"><img width="200" height="128" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/stars_1.gif" title="Stars_1" alt="Stars_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>Of the various ratings scales, 5-point scales are probably the most common on the Internet. You can find them not just in my own RPGnet, but also on Amazon, Netflix, and iTunes, as well as many other sites and services. Unfortunately 5-point rating scales also face many challenges in their use, and different studies suggest different flaws with this particular methodology.</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://sloan.ucr.edu/category/working-papers/product-reviews/">one study</a> using Amazon data has shown that many <em>undetailed</em> ratings (where the rater isn't required to add any additional information other than the rating they select) show a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimodal_distribution">bimodal distribution</a>.&nbsp; In other words the distribution of ratings tends to cluster around two different numbers (e.g., 1 and 5) rather than offering a normal distribution where the ratings cluster around a single height (e.g., 3). Thus the median of these ratings is not an accurate reflection of product quality, but instead is a statement of conflicting opinions.</p>

<p>Second, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">our own study</a> using RPGnet data has shown that many <em>detailed</em> ratings (where the rater does add additional information, in this case a full review) offer normal distributions, however it is biased toward the high end of the scale. On RPGnet, for example, we discovered that 90% of this 5-point rating system was 3 or higher with an average around 4.</p>

<p><a href="http://360.yahoo.com/profile-9lciejI3aafX1stHPoIRNmkmv4EowQ--">Randy Farmer</a> of Yahoo suggests that this scale limitation is particularly troublesome for fan-based ratings, such as those found on episodic TV sites:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Only the fans of a show evaluate the episodes, and being fans, will never rate an episode one or two stars, ever. I've seen this attempted over and over on the net with the same results every time: Each episode of a show is 4-stars +/- .5 stars. This goes all the way back to the Babylon-5 website, probably the first source for this kind of data.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>(And indeed, the TV episode <a href="http://www.tv.com/babylon-5/tko/episode/25148/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;14">TKO</a>, from <em>Babylon 5</em>'s first season, is considered an entirely atrocious episode by even the fans. Yet it has a 6.1 of 10 &quot;Fair&quot; rating on <a href="http://www.tv.com">tv.com</a>.)</p>

<p>Thus even when a bimodal distribution is not a problem, on a 5-point scale the upward bias often results in only 2 or 3 meaningful data points. This is problematic because it minimizes differentiation. In many cases, a 5-star rating system where most of the ratings are either 3 or 4 is actually no better then just a thumbs-up/thumbs-down rating system. </p>

<p>However, given that 5-point scales are probably here to stay, we are forced to make the best use of them we can.</p>

<p>First, we need to provide raters with <em>incentives</em>, so that they provide meaningful ratings. We've already seen that this can be done by requesting detailed ratings: when a person takes the time to write text, and knows that his name will be attached to it, he generally does a better job in his rating. There are other possible incentives techniques as well, such as RPGnet's new <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_/TTnT_191.phtml">XP System</a>.</p>

<p>Second, we need to provide means for a 5-point scale to become more meaningful by encouraging raters to use not just the top half of the scale, but the bottom half as well. One method to accomplish this is to make ratings <em>distinct</em> -- as I briefly mentioned in my previous article on this topic -- and encourage standards so that an &quot;average&quot; rating is 2 or 3, not 4.</p>

<p>As an example of how to accomplish both of these goals with already existing 5-point rating scales, I've detailed my own experiences with using ratings on two popular services -- iTunes and Amazon. By providing myself with incentives and making my use of ratings very distinctive, I have created more meaningful and useful output for myself.</p>

<h3>Music Ratings - iTunes</h3>

<p>Apple's iTunes software offers you the ability to rate individual songs with a 0-5 Star rating. If you use iTunes with an iPod, you can change the rating of a song on your iPod and the change will be reflected in your iTunes database the next time you sync your iPod. The &quot;Shuffle Songs&quot; feature available on more modern iPods has an option to have songs with higher ratings be played more often. A very powerful feature, Smart Playlists, can dynamically create sophisticated playlists based on ratings. All of this makes rating music on iTunes very useful.</p>

<p>After Shannon and I wrote our Rating Systems article, I examined the ratings in my iTunes catalog. Using the <a href="http://girtby.net/archives/2005/11/03/itunes-library-preening/">Alastair's</a> fabulous XLST <a href="http://girtby.net/offerings/itunes-ratings-stats/">iTunes rating statistics tool</a>, I discovered that the ratings I created in iTunes clearly were biased overly high, matching the pattern we'd described. I had far too many songs rated with 4 Stars, and almost nothing rated 1 or 2. This made my ratings less useful.</p>

<p>So over the last few months I've completely revamped my iTunes ratings. Since I can't change the user interface, I've changed my behavior. I'm also taking advantage of two other fields: &quot;checked&quot; which I use to give more distinctiveness to my ratings, and &quot;play count&quot; which shows whether or not I've listened to something through to the end.</p>

<p>Here are the criteria I used:</p>

<p><strong>Rated 5 - Exemplars <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_5_checked.png" title="Myrating_5_checked" alt="Myrating_5_checked" />:</strong> Only my most favorite songs are rated 5. They have to meet the following criteria: they make me feel good or excite me no matter how often I listen to them, I can typically listen to them often without getting tired of them, and they are the best of their particular genre.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 4 - Great <img border="0" alt="Myrating_4_checked" title="Myrating_4_checked" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_4_checked.png" />:</strong> There is only a small difference between a song that is rated 4 and 5 in my ratings -- typically it doesn't excite me or make me smile quite as much, or it isn't necessarily an exemplar of its genre. However, I still can typically listen to them often without getting tired of them. Items that are rated 4 and 5 are ones that I carry on my iPod Shuffle.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 4 - Great (Unchecked) <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_4_unchecked.png" title="Myrating_4_unchecked" alt="Myrating_4_unchecked" />:</strong> There are a few songs that I do consider to be great, but that I only want to play when I'm in the mood for them, or I want to only play in a specific order, or they &quot;don't play well&quot; with other music. For instance I love the song &quot;The Highwayman&quot; by Loreena McKennitt, however, it is over 10 minutes long and I just don't want to hear that type of song unless I'm in the mood for it. Other examples are the 12 songs that make up Mussorgsky's &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;&nbsp; -- I want them played in order when I do play them, and I really don't want them played in the middle of my other songs. Unfortunately, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items, so I don't have a Smart Playlist for these; instead I keep them in a regular playlist.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 3 - Good <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_3_checked.png" title="Myrating_3_checked" alt="Myrating_3_checked" />:</strong> These are songs I like. Typically I can play them regularly but not too often. Songs rated 3-5 go on my iPod Nano.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 3 - Good (Unchecked) <img border="0" alt="Myrating_3_unchecked" title="Myrating_3_unchecked" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_3_unchecked.png" />:</strong> There is a lot of music that I think is Good, but I don't want to play all the time. I have a large catalog of sound tracks from movies. All but a few of those tracks are in this category. Again, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items in a Smart Playlist, so I have several regular playlists for these items.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 2 - Ok <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_2_checked.png" title="Myrating_2_checked" alt="Myrating_2_checked" />:</strong> I have very diverse musical tastes, starting with jazz, various ethnic and world music, and also including quite a bit of pop, rap, R&amp;B, punk, and metal that I enjoy. I don't enjoy them all the time -- but I do like them to pop up every once in a while for variety. So I rate these 2 and leave them checked. I have an old 40GB iPod that I take on long trips, and it stores everything I have that is checked and rated 2-5.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 2 - Ok (Unchecked) <img border="0" alt="Myrating_2_unchecked" title="Myrating_2_unchecked" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_2_unchecked.png" />:</strong> Some songs are OK, but I really have to be in the mood specifically for that song. Listening to Jimmy Buffet's &quot;Margaritaville&quot; can be a guilty pleasure on a lazy summer day at the beach, but it isn't something I want to regularly listen to. I have a number of special playlists for songs rated like this.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 1 - Don't Like <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_1_checked.png" title="Myrating_1_checked" alt="Myrating_1_checked" />:</strong> These are the songs that I don't like. They're just not my style. Many are still quality music, they just doesn't work for me. I do keep most of these for completeness -- it might just be one or two songs on the album, and I want to keep the album complete. Or I keep it in case my tastes change. But in general, once something is rate 1 Star, I'll probably never listen to it again.</p>

<p><strong>Rated 1 - Trash (Unchecked) <img border="0" alt="Myrating_1_unchecked" title="Myrating_1_unchecked" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_1_unchecked.png" />:</strong> These are songs that not only do I not like, they just are not good music. I don't like most rap music, but I can tell that most are still quality. Some are junk -- these I rate 1 and uncheck, and are candidates for deletion the next time I purge my collection.</p>

<p><strong>Unrated &amp; Listened <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_0_checked.png" title="Myrating_0_checked" alt="Myrating_0_checked" />, playcount &gt; 0:</strong> If I've listened to something through to the end, but haven't rated it yet, it shows up in this Smart Playlist. Periodically I check this Smart Playlist, sort by playcount, and try to rate everything that I've listened to more then once.</p>

<p><strong>Unrated &amp; Unlistened <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/myrating_0_checked.png" title="Myrating_0_checked" alt="Myrating_0_checked" />, play count=0:</strong> This is the default when a new song is added to my library. So any song that is unrated, checked, and has a play count of 0 shows up in my &quot;Unrated &amp; Unlistened&quot; Smart Playlist. When I'm in the mood for variety, I go through this playlist and rate songs.</p>

<p>Modifying my rating system in this way has caused my average rating for music to change from around 4 to somewhere between 2 and 3. It will probably, over time, become closer to 2 as I rate more of my collection. This gives me a lot of distinctiveness so that I can create Smart Playlists that work well for me.</p>

<p>Obviously rating a large music collection can become a chore -- you don't want to spend your limited music listening time always fine tuning your ratings. So I have some approaches that make it easier for me to rate my music with less effort:</p>

<ul><li><p>First, I sorted my catalog by my old ratings, and modified everything down by 1, Starting with everything rated 2 becoming 1, 3 becoming 2, etc. This gave me a good base to start with</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/exemplar_smart_playlist.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=512,height=216,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="84" border="0" alt="Exemplar_smart_playlist" title="Exemplar_smart_playlist" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/exemplar_smart_playlist.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Next I created Smart Playlists for each rating, i.e. &quot;Rating 5 - Exemplar&quot; with &quot;Match only checked songs&quot; and &quot;Live updating&quot; checked. I then added &quot;Play Count&quot; as a column to my view, and sorted by it. This gave me the songs that I played the most and least, and I adjusted some songs up and down accordingly.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=512,height=241,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="94" border="0" alt="Plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist" title="Plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/plays_well_with_others_smart_playlist.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Then I created a new Smart Playlist that simply plays songs rated 3 to 5, limiting the list to the first 100 GB selected by random (i.e. everything random), and saved this Smart Playlist as &quot;Plays Well With Others&quot;. I play this on occasion in the background, and when I hear something that jars me I know something isn't rated right. Thus without a lot of effort I can change ratings for songs that no longer fit their rating, or uncheck items where the rating was appropriate but it &quot;didn't play well with others&quot;.</p></li>

<li><p>I try to be aware when I'm using my iPod of what a songs rating is, and change it if it seems wrong. The next time I sync the iPod my ratings will be adjusted in my iTunes catalog.</p></li>

<li><p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/play_count.png" title="Play_count" alt="Play_count" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />I also try to be aware of Play Count -- this number only goes up if you play a song to the end. So even if I'm not able to take a look at the rating (for instance when I'm in a car), I can at least forward to the next song. Periodically I review the play counts for songs that I've rated and consider moving them up and down accordingly. Of course, this means that I have to be careful and not let the iPod keep running when I'm not listening.</p></li></ul>

<p>A tip for those of you that do put a lot of effort into your iTunes ratings: I've learned the hard way that unlike most song information, the rating is <strong>NOT</strong> stored in the song itself, so if your iTunes database gets corrupted, or you move your music to another server, you'll lose all your ratings. One way to avoid this is to periodically backup your ratings into a field that is stored in the song itself. I personally use the &quot;Grouping&quot; field as it is rarely used, select all songs with the same rating and click on &quot;Get Info&quot;, and change the Grouping field to &quot;My Rating: 5 Stars&quot;.</p>

<p>I only have 11% of my collection rated so far, but using this system I'm finding it a lot easier to manage my ratings. I'm already getting many benefits from it -- I'm playing my music more often, my iPods typically have the music I want on them, and various music discovery services can use my ratings to help me identify new music I might enjoy. This provides the <em>incentive</em> to keep me entering meaningful ratings.</p>

<h3>Book Ratings - Amazon</h3>

<p>Amazon also uses a 5-Star rating system, and your ratings can be used by Amazon to help you find books that you might like. Though I like to support my local bookstores, it is this feature that brings me back to Amazon time and again. Whenever I browse through Amazon and see a book I've already read I try to take the time to update my rating.</p>

<p>Amazon has a number of different tools to assist you in your ratings. If you are an Amazon customer, you can go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr/?ie=UTF8&amp;collection=owned">Improve Your Recommendations: Edit Items You Own</a> and see all the books that you've purchased and quickly rate them with a nice AJAX interface. You can also review items that you've already rated, whether or not you own them, at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/iyr/?ie=UTF8&amp;collection=rated">Improve Your Recommendations: Edit Items You've Rated</a>.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=509,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/amazon_your_media_library.png"><img width="200" height="159" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/amazon_your_media_library.png" title="Amazon_your_media_library" alt="Amazon_your_media_library" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Amazon has also recently added a very nice web service called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/library/">Your Media Library</a> that can be used to help manage your media library of books, music, and dvds. I personally only have used it to manage my books and dvds, as I find rating albums useless -- it is songs that I prefer to rate.</p>

<p>After browsing through my ratings to date, I discovered the same flaws I found iTunes -- my ratings typically were too high; most were a 4. This is particularly encouraged by the popup when your cursor is over the Stars &quot;1 - I hate it, 2 - I don't like it, 3 - It's Ok, 4 - I like it, and 5 - I love it&quot;. I suspect if I use the same trick that I use for iTunes of making a rating of 2 Stars mean &quot;Ok&quot; I could potentially cause the recommendation engine to be less effective (though it could possibly make it better, I don't know). So I am being much more brutal with my ratings and pushing many more down to 3, so that my ratings of 4 and 5 have more meaning.</p>

<p><strong>5 Stars <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_5_star.png" title="Amazon_5_star" alt="Amazon_5_star" />:</strong> These have to be the exemplars -- the best books I've ever read, would be glad to read again, would be proud to show off on my best bookshelf, and will buy extra copies to give to friends.</p>

<p><strong>4 Stars <img border="0" alt="Amazon_4_star" title="Amazon_4_star" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_4_star.png" />:</strong> These have to be really good books -- most of them I'm willing to read again and I promote them by offering to loan them to my more discriminating friends. Although I may keep them on my bookshelf I'd rather give them to a friend then sell them at a used book store.</p>

<p><strong>3 Stars <img border="0" alt="Amazon_3_star" title="Amazon_3_star" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_3_star.png" />:</strong> These are books are decent books, and I do share them with my voracious reader friends. But I don't push them and I'm much more likely to sell them at a used bookstore then keep them on my shelf. This is the rating that I significantly underused previously, and I'm finding that the key discriminator for me so far is how much I feel like recommending this to friends who are more discriminating readers.</p>

<p><strong>2 Stars <img border="0" alt="Amazon_2_star" title="Amazon_2_star" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_2_star.png" />:</strong> This rating is where the Amazon rating system fails the most -- these are suppost to be books that &quot;I don't like&quot;, however, most of the time I don't buy books that I probably wouldn't like, much less read them, so I have very few in this category. However, I've decided this category is for books that are just not quite good enough, or are slightly disappointing. Not bad, or disliked, but just somewhat disappointing.</p>

<p><strong>1 Stars <img border="0" alt="Amazon_1_star" title="Amazon_1_star" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/amazon_1_star.png" />:</strong> This is where I put the books that I don't like, or worse, I hate. Not many here, but I'm willing to risk more then many people are so I have some. Also books go here that just don't fit my interest, like romance novels that get recommended to me because I like some crossover fantasy-romance authors.</p>

<p>Since I started more accurately rating my books at Amazon, I've found that their suggestions for other books to read to be more accurate. Thus I am getting value from rating these books, and I have <em>incentive</em> to continue to make the effort.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Offering an incentive for people to rate is important for ratings of all sorts, with both individual gain and status recognition being powerful motivators.</p>

<p>However the easiest technique for making a 5-point rating scale more useful is to make it &quot;distinct&quot;. If a user has a more specific meaning for each rating, ratings will slowly settle toward a truer average, and thus more of each rating scale will be used. We've also tried this technique recently on RPGnet, with our new <a href="http://index.rpg.net/">Gaming Index</a>; and thus far our new 10-point scale -- which has distinct meanings for each number -- is averaging <a href="http://index.rpg.net/browse.phtml?count=50&amp;type=Best&amp;productCategory=Entries">7.27</a>. That's still a fair amount above the real average of 5.5, but at least it's below the 8+ rating that our old double 5-point scale resulted in.</p>

<p>Often you, as a consumer of rating systems, will be making use of rating scales designed by others, rather than those you're designing yourself. For those cases it often makes sense to design your own rules for what each number means, and to do so in such a way that your median is the average of the scale, rather than toward one of the extremes. When you do, even if you're using a tight 5-point scale you'll end up with enough differentiation for it to actually be more meaningful than a thumbs up or a thumbs down.</p>

EXCERPT:
In Collective Choice: Rating Systems I discuss ratings scales of various sorts, from eBay's 3-point scale to RPGnet's double 5-point scale, and BoardGame Geek's 10-point scale.

Stars_1

Of the various ratings scales, 5-point scales are probably the most common on the Internet. You can find them not just in my own RPGnet, but also on Amazon, Netflix, and iTunes, as well as many other sites and services. Unfortunately 5-point rating scales also face many challenges in their use, and different studies suggest different flaws with this particular methodology. (Post continues with more analysis, and discussion of how more effectively use iTunes and Amazon ratings...)

Averaging all episodes you get a mean score of 8.19 with a standard deviation of 0.84 - a *very* narrow range.

Context and Motivation matter more than scale in getting reusable scores out of rating systems. As I like to tell the folks here at Yahoo! – the person creating the rating has to get something out of the transaction other than just altruism.

I thought the issue, like Randy Farmer suggests, was that only positive discrete scales always tend to their maximum.  The problem then in rating systems, like you mentioned I think earlier, is that readers have to interpret what the real norm and limits are.  Even if every rating is in the upper quartile.  You may want to check out what I did in Playerep (http://www.playerep.com), where the rating system is based on election but not a fixed scale (always norming to zero without influence).   FWIW. Thanks.

I like your classification scheme for iTunes. I'm going to have to work on adapting my scale (which is definitely showing signs of skewing towards the high end).

One thing, though. You mention that you can't create smart playlists to show unchecked songs. It's true that you can't do it with only one playlist, but you can do so with 2:

#1) Any playlist (for example, let's say your smart playlist for 4 star, checked songs, so you have it set (I assume) for My Rating = 4, Match Only Checked Songs = checked)

#2) Use these criteria:  My Rating = 4, Playlist Is Not <playlist #1>. Leave match only checked songs unchecked, and enable live updating and you have a smart playlist that shows you your unchecked 4-star songs.

>>Unfortunately, iTunes does not let you select only unchecked items, so I don't have a Smart Playlist for these; instead I keep them in a regular playlist.

You can:
Make a smart playlist called 'Checked' with a rule that is always true (e.g. artist does not contain (leave the field emtpy), or bitrate > 0). Create a smart playlist called 'Unchecked' with the rule: 'Playlist is not Checked'. There you have all your unchecked files.

From there you can make smart ones that use this Unchecked playlist.

I like your rating system. I have 40% on a 3star now, and around 25% for 2 and 4 stars. I might scale it down a little bit more.

hmm, after typing this I read the comments and see Adam McDonald already mentioned something similar about the unchecked items. I'll leave it here anyway...

Christopher, I think some, if not all, of the issues with the 5-point rating system could be addressed with a better UI. For example, displaying a normal distribution curve skewed by accumulated rating to nudge raters away from the extremes. Of course, this doesn't work well if sample size is too small which usually happens on the far end of the long tail.

I will be speaking next Tuesday (July 11th) at the monthly meeting of <a href="http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20060711/">BayCHI</a>, the San Francisco Bay Area Chapter of ACM SIGCHI (Computer Human Interface Special Interest Group), along with <a href="http://www.goldhaber.org/">Michael H. Goldhaber</a>.</p>

<p>The synopsis of my topic is:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The Dunbar Number, Unstructured Trust, and Why Groups Don't Scale</strong><br /> We are relying increasingly on internet-mediated social software tools for our day-to-day interaction with other people. To design this type of software, we must better understand the psychology and social dynamics of individuals in groups. Awareness of what makes us human is now often as important to the success of the software as is understanding software architecture and code. One particular sociological factor, the Dunbar Number, is useful in understanding why groups don't scale at different group sizes. A deeper awareness of why groups have different behaviors, the nature
of unstructured trust, and which current tools appear to work best at different scales, can give guidance to both the online facilitator and the social software designer.</p></blockquote>

<p>Michael H. Goldhaber will be speaking on:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.parc.com/about/directions.html"><img border="0" alt="Maptoparc" title="Maptoparc" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/maptoparc.gif" style="margin: 5px; float: right;" /></a><strong>The Real Nature of the Emerging Attention Economy: Seen As a New Level in the Massively Multiplayer Game Known as Western Culture:</strong><br /> Think of the human world as a Massively Multiple Interactive Game (which it is). As interactions change and increase, we are passing to a new level, something that hasn’t really happened to the same depth for centuries. The rules, fundamental values, and just about everything else are diverging from what was familiar in the level characterized by the exchange of Money, the prevalence of Markets and the dominance of Industrial production of standardized goods (call this MMI). The new level also depends on human abilities and desires, but now what matters most is our strictly limited abilities to pay attention and our much greater (on average) desires to receive it. The full passage will take many decades, but we are already well along.</p></blockquote>

<p>The location is at PARC's <a href="http://www.baychi.org/program/directions/">George E. Pake Auditorium</a> in Palo Alto, and the talk starts at 7:30. There also an optional <a href="http://www.baychi.org/calendar/20060711/dinner/">dinner</a> beforehand <a href="http://www.californiacafe.com/palo_alto.php">nearby</a> at 5:30.</p>

I've been a moderator/host/forum leader for various bulletin boards and other online communities since the early 1980s; first on CompuServe, later on GEnie and AOL, and then professionally in the early days of Consensus Development. One of the behaviors that happens in online communities and that I rarely see elsewhere is flaming -- where one member writes an extremely inappropriate, typically passionately worded attack on another. Flaming behavior can hurt an online community.</p>

<p>It is <a href="http://www.internet-guide.co.uk/email-flame.html">commonly thought</a> that flames occur because <em>&quot;there is very little proper policing done on the Internet&quot;</em> but I believe this to be false. Instead, I believe that it is the consequence of the medium primarily existing as text.</p>

<p>In fact, what you'll observe if you study individual flames is that they typically start as an escalation of emotion, only spiraling later into passionate and personal arguments. The only way to stop flames from destroying a community is to break this cycle.</p>



<p>So I've taught all my staffers over the years my ideas on what causes the cycle of flames, and how to avoid them. One particular piece of advice that I give is in regards to how emotions are amplified in the online text medium.</p>

<p>This happens for several different reasons:</p>

<p>Since text is lacking tonal and
visual context, we have a tendency to over-interpret any emotional
content that does exist (<a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1589611/0">link to paper)</a>. In fact, we may have <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70179-0.html?tw=wn_index_2">no better than a random chance of correctly interpreting the emotional tone</a> of ironic vs sincere text in a message (<a href="http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/nicholas.epley/EpleyKruger.pdf">link to Epley/Kruger paper</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, we tend to respond to someone's emotional state by expressions of similar intensity (this phenomenon is known as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521449480/202-9000930-0565465">Emotional Contagion</a>). And the higher the level of intensity of our emotions, the less our ability to be empathetic (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=8436029&amp;dopt=Abstract">link to paper</a>).</p>

<p>These tendencies lead into a vicious feedback cycle.</p>

<ul>
<li>One person starts with a very trivial or subtle emotional context, say irony.</li>
<li>This is interpreted at a higher level of emotions, such as sarcasm.</li>
<li>A reply is made at a similar level of emotion, for example being sarcastic.</li>
<li>This, in turn, is interpreted at an even higher level of emotion, maybe a mild insult.</li>
<li>In turn this is replied to at a similarly intense level.</li>
<li><strong>A flame is born!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Thus I now find that now there are certain words and phrases that I avoid using when responding to people online. I have to be very careful with irony and sarcasm, and when I use them I include symbols such as smilies to such give the emotional context that is missing from the text. I find that even the slightest hint of blame will be over-interpreted. I avoid the words &quot;should&quot; and &quot;didn't&quot;, never tell someone that they forgot something, etc.</p>

<p>My online community staffers have found understanding this cycle an important tool in moderating the communities they lead.</p>

EXCERPT:
One of the behaviors that happens in online communities and that I rarely see elsewhere is flaming, where one member writes an extremely inappropriate, typically passionately worded attack on another. Flaming behavior can hurt a online community. (Post continues on the causes of the cycle of flames...)

Interesting blog entry at http://joshreads.com/?p=518 on the use of quotation marks in cartoons to denote irony. Of course, this conflicts with using quotes for quotes, quotes for emphasis, and quotes for calling attention to a phrase — all common uses of quotes in text. No wonder we can't interpret irony accurately.

The gents over at 37 Signals recently proposed a "Troll Cap" standard:

http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/introducing_the_troll_cap.php

Kind of tongue-in-cheek, but it almost points the way to a Microformat. Combined with a single log-on identity, being repetitively called out by one's peers as a disruptor of peace could begin to have actual consequences to one's online life ourside of one particular community or another.

Thanks for the visit Mr. Allen.  Something that at times helps in online forums is the use of emoticons.  They can be very helpful at steering conversations into the "humor" side of things.  (The use of quotations was purely intentional and trying to convey not just irony but also sarcasm.)

It's funny because I think most people understand intuitively that the written word is limited for conveying tone, at least in practical terms. Yet, it is easy for the most mundane online conversations to devolve into flamewars. I think part of it, too, is that people overestimate their ability to overcome any disagreement by continued conversation.

I find this analysis of flaming very interesting, but did not find the approach I take, so let me describe this one. Flaming, from a social psychological point of view, is a force released from the group through the individual. Compare it to the experiment on Jewish girls whose blood-pressure was taken, while casually remarking that "Jewish girls could handle less pain" seemingly unrelated to the action taking place. This significantly caused these girls to allow much more pain infliction. Or the athlete who runs faster when he passes the cheering fans: he feels one of them and the best of them at that time. Flaming occurs when a group is aiming for the power to steer the whole group and not just themselves. This is particularly dangerous to democracy at whichever scale you look for it: the individuals seemingly each have their private conviction and these 'accidentally' add up to become a strong democratic force. However, like we have seen in the Hamas election, the aim might as well be to be strong as a group and not care about the individual idea, as long as power (flaming) is the result. This is mimecry, studied for a lifetime by French philosopher René Girard. It explains how societies evolve and postpone aggression, towards the scapegoat. In the end, it is exactly the way the judeo-christian society arose and how islam is now invading EU.

"Trolling" is a relatively new cultural concept and not enough analysis has been done historically to distinguish the disruption of "trolling" from the legitimate act of dissent against group-think. Many forums royals wield the club of labeling others as "trolls" to enforce group-think. A persistence of dissent against a group is just persistence of dissent, it's ok, it's not necessarily "disruptive," and suppressing such dissent in the name of some imagined Internet social harmony merely leads to stagnation and insularity. Where is the fresh perspective supposed to come from?

Re: "One person starts with a very trivial or subtle emotional context, say irony."

Well, stop right there. By creating this cascade that leads to a flame, it appears as if you're absolving the original poster in some fashion. Why is it ok for him to be ironical? It's true that there is an acceleration and amplification of emotion, and others "overract" or "take it out of proportion" -- but is the blame for the flame them only on the shoulders of all those reacting? Why does the OP get a pass?

Certain forums are so poisoned by bad faith, unevenly moderated, and completely held hostage by group-think that no newcomer, or even veteran with good faith, can look at the ironical any more and take them merely as "trivial" or "subtle". They create the tiny tinder and others light the match; why are they not made responsible for their tinder?

WHY YOU DIRTY S.O.B! HOW DARE YOU THINK YOU KNOW ABOUT FLAMING!...

That is what I expected to see in the comments section. Of course your readers are far too sophisticated to go for the easy joke...

One of the things that has been shown is how much of communication is conveyed by facial expression and body language. That doesn't even touch the range you have with vocal inflection, volume and pacing. 

If I don't see any feedback from my comment, I can't instantly correct myself. I can't see the look on the person's face to know that they don't get I'm being sarcastic. 

I'm going to be working with two people next week who have problems with monotone delivery. This is especially difficult because they will be doing most of these presentations over the phone.  

To "amp up" the level of information to deal with the loss of visuals, I'm suggesting they do a few mechanical things (like marking the text to remind them to pause or moving to a more descriptive narrative of events so that the audience can follow along in their heads)

When you get to text, you lose the information you can get from the voice. Unless that is replaced somehow (like  with smiley faces as you mentioned) people can misinterpet. 

So for people using text they sometimes need to be explicit in ways that is not necessary with face to face, video or audio communications.

One other thing with flames, I'll never forget the first time I had a meeting with someone who had flamed me not knowing who I was or that he would ever met me. He was very nice in person and it surprised me that the flames came from him. No doubt the social mores kicked in that say you don't scream "WHO IS THIS IDIOT WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT COPYRIGHT IS! SHIT HE EVEN SPELLS IT COPYWRITE!" in real life, but you can do it on email.

Finally, here is another thing to add to the flame game mix. Did you ever notice that when you are reading something written by someone you know and you realise you are "hearing" them say it in your head while you are reading it? Because you know them and their pacing and style you can more easily detect something that is sarcastic that they have written because you can "hear" them saying that in your head.

With anonymous people you don't know that until you get to know them better, either in person or over a period of time reading them and responding to them.

Once again an excellent post and I expect that six months from now this will be the new topic in the news, "Who is flaming me, and why?"
That's our Mr. A, Always six months ahead of the curve!

At http://brudnopis.blogspot.com/2006/04/one-email-per-day-moderation-scheme.html I proposed a 'one email per day' scheme to break the vicious circle of flame wars.  After discussing it in some email lists I am now more aware how much it depends on the mailing list nature, but still I think it might be the solution in some circumstances.

<p> However, I don't consider myself a venture capitalist. Instead, I am what is known as an &quot;angel investor&quot;.</p>

<p>This week has also seen a new topic enter the blog zeitgeist: the topic of reforming or reinventing venture capital. This topic was initially raised by <a href="http://scripting.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/how-to-reform-the-vc-industry-in-five-easy-steps/">Dave Winer</a>, followed by <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/01/28/the-ventures-we-need/">Robert Scoble</a>, <a href="http://www.itgarage.com/node/737">Doc Searls</a>, <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2006/01/the_broken_vc_m.html">Jeff Nolan</a>, <a href="http://www.ensight.org/archives/2006/01/28/disrupting-venture-capital/&gt;Jeremy Wright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=" http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p="134">Michael Arrington</a>, <a href="http://www.thatedeguy.com/archives/2006/01/the-future-of-vc">Thatedeguy</a> and <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/scripting.wordpress.com%2F2006%2F01%2F28%2Fhow-to-reform-the-vc-industry-in-five-easy-steps%2F">many more</a>.</p>

<p>All types of venture investment -- seed, angel, venture, and institutional alike -- carry with it great risks and great rewards. But before we can reinvent venture capital and related venture funding methods like angel capital, we need to understand how it works.</p>

<h3>So What is a Venture Capitalist?</h3>

<p>A venture capitalist is a partner or associate in a venture capital management firm, which manages money on behalf of large institutional investors.</p>

<p>Basically, a large institutional investor (such as a pension fund or an insurance company) can statistically afford to invest a small part of their portfolio -- perhaps from 1% to as much as 5% -- in high-risk, long-term investments. If they lose the money outright, their other more stable investments have a good chance of making up the loss. But if the high risk investment does well, they can substantially improve their IRR (internal rate of return). To a certain extent they can't lose if they are careful. So these institutional investors invest in a number of types of high-risk funds, including such investments as venture capital funds.</p>

<p>A venture capital management company will manage one or more of these funds, investing in private companies. These VC management firms operate off of a management fee, from 2% to 3% of the capital invested to date. Thus all of the salaries for the staff of a VC management firm are paid, even if the investments are a failure. In addition, if any of the investments are successful, the VC management company earns 20% off of the top of the gain (called a &quot;carry&quot;), which is distributed to all of the full partners in the VC management firm, and sometimes a little of it to the associates.</p>

<p>It is the VC associates that do the brunt of the work for a VC management firm. They make a good salary, but the real return is if they are able to do well in identifying, managing, and selling new startups; then they are invited to become a partner the next time the VC management firm raises a fund. Then if the fund that they are a partner in does well, they can make a true fortune, or even start their own VC management firm.</p>

<p>However, the odds are against the VC associate. It's common wisdom that an associate can't easily manage more the 7 firms at a time. Other common wisdom says that 1 in 5 investments will survive to break even and that 1 in 20 will &quot;make the fund&quot;, i.e. pay for all the losses in the other 19 investments. Some newer firms say 1 in 10, but I'll go with the older more conservative numbers. Thus associates are incentivized to try to manage more then 7 investments and to be smarter than their peers in the firm, so that at least one of their investments will be the 1 in 20 that makes the fund. This makes it easier for the associate to become a partner in the future, as at best 1 in 3 or 1 in 5 associates becomes a partner. Cutthroat competition between associates exists in some firms. This pressure often adds the perception that associates don't give enough attention to companies in their portfolio; they want their startups to do well, but the odds are it is another company that will make it, or a startup managed by peer associates. So they divide their attention. This is not unrelated to the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar Triage</a> problem.</p>

<p>Another problem that VC management firms face is the number of investments they are able to effectively handle. If there are 5-6 associates and 2-4 partners, there is probably a max of 50 investments that they have time to manage. If they are managing a $500 million dollar fund, that means that they have to invest at least $10M in a company, but in fact that is more likely to be $25M over time. If 1 in 20 makes the fund, that $25.0M has to give a return of $250M.&nbsp; Thus when entrepreneurs complain that VCs will not invest in their company, it is often because the VCs can't figure out how to invest a minimum of $25M and turn out at the end with $250M. A related problem is that a startup that might have a successful business model that could grow into a profitable $50M annual revenues will be encouraged to take a more risky route so that they can go public, which requires a minimum of $100-200M annual revenues.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variety in VC management firms; some VCs have smaller funds under management, others give their associates more of a share, others have different management fees or carry percentages, and most specialize in some way: either vertically in a particular field, or horizontally in a particular stage of investment. For instance, there are some VC firms known as mezzanine firms that only invest in your company right before they think it can go public. </p>

<p>This is the way most VC management firms work. Periodically a new VC management firms will explore and push the limits of the above boundary conditions, but the more edges they attempt, the more likely they will fail.</p>

<h3>My Three Angels</h3>

<p>So what is an angel investor? I learned a lot of what I know from the 3 angel investors that invested in my software startup, Consensus Development.</p>

<h3>Gifford Pinchot -- Partner Angel</h3>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/gif_and_libba.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=467,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="145" border="0" alt="Gif_and_libba" title="Gif_and_libba" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/gif_and_libba.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Gifford Pinchot, with his wife Libba, was my first angel investor in Consensus Development. We met at a Maxis meeting where Gifford had been asked to facilitate the formation of a new startup to create simulation software. At the end of the meeting we left frustrated with the results of the meeting, but Gifford liked what he heard about my broader vision. Gifford flew me to San Diego, where we walked the beach and discussed my vision for collaborative software. He liked what he heard, and later in the month flew me to his home in Connecticut, where I stayed for a month in a barn guest house near his home while we worked on our first business plan.</p>

<p>Gifford only invested a low 5 figures, which got me started. However, it wasn't his money that was his most valuable contribution -- it was his time. Over the years he probably put 5-10% of his into time as Chairman of Consensus Development working with me, talking to me, advising me, and coached me. When our first software effort, InfoLog (a folksonomy tagging program like del.icio.us that was a decade too early) failed, he didn't walk away and instead encouraged me to continue. I dug deeper into the problem, discovered that trust and security were a key obstacle, and created a profitable consulting business. But Gifford encouraged me when I said we were going to take the risk of dropping all of our profitable consulting and focusing on a product, SSL Plus. Later, when this company was being shopped around to various buyers, Gifford spent lots of time doing due diligence, and ultimately came on half-time as CEO so that I could concentrate on selling the business.</p>

<p>In the end, Gifford earned probably 7 figures on his initial 5 figure investment, close to a hundred-fold return on the dollars he invested. However, his real investment was the time he spent with me -- almost 10 years of never giving up.</p>

<h3>Scott Loftesness -- Seed Angel</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.sjl.us"><img border="0" alt="People_scott" title="People_scott" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/people_scott.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
I met <a href="http://www.sjl.us/">Scott Loftesness</a> when he was the executive vice president at <a href="http://corporate.visa.com">Visa International</a>. We learned of each other through CompuServe, where we both were sysops in the 80s. I did some consulting for him at Visa in the groupware area over a couple of years and we grew to respect and trust each other. I came to him when I branched out from groupware consulting and began to include consulting on cryptographic security. I'd seen an opportunity--I had a potential contract from <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com">RSA Data Security</a> to be a distributor of <a href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/~dunigan/rsaref.txt">RSAREF</a>--but in order to take advantage of this opportunity I needed some seed capital.</p>

<p>Scott invested over twice what Gifford invested, but still 5 figures. However, like Gifford, what I gained from my association with Scott was a lot more then the seed capital. He had a respected name in the industry -- a friend at Visa USA told me &quot;Scott is where all innovation at Visa flows from.&quot; He joined my board of directors, supported our risky choice to drop all groupware and cryptographic consulting to focus on our SSL project, helped tremendously in doing due diligence on potential buyers, and was pivotal to the negotiations to close our final sale of Consensus Development.</p>

<p>In the end, Scott Loftesness also did quite well in his investment in Consensus Development. His involvement on the day-to-day operation of Consensus Development was significantly less, but he was always around to support and advise us when we needed him.</p>

<h3>Jim Bidzos -- Hands-Off Angel</h3>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bidzos.jpg" title="Bidzos" alt="Bidzos" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />
Jim Bidzos was the CEO of RSA Data Security, whose firm had a critical patent on almost all meaningful cryptographic security. Over the years I did a lot of consulting for him to support various projects like RSAREF in standards, to create client tools for their Certificate Services Division, and to help with the founding of <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign</a>.</p>

<p>One day I told Jim that RSAREF would never be successful in his goal of promoting the RSA algorithm in security standards as long as it could only be sold through RSA salespeople. They preferred to sell RSA's premiere toolkit, BSAFE. I somewhat jokingly proposed that maybe Consensus Development should sell it instead. To my surprise, he agreed.</p>

<p>A couple of years later I leveraged the fact that Consensus Development had the only RSA toolkit available other then RSA's own to get the contract to develop the reference implementation of SSL 3.0 for Netscape. I took this Netscape contract back to Jim and said that I needed some investment to make this successfully. He invested a middle six figures in Consensus Development in return for a percentage that was roughly equivalent to that of Gifford and Scott, but because of his involvement as CEO of RSA Data Security he could not be on our board of directors.</p>

<p>After this investment, Jim had very little to do with Consensus Development. In fact, he had spread his angel money so widely in the cryptographic security industry that he was also invested in a couple of our competitors. In the end his investment was worth roughly 10 times what he invested, but the cachet of being able to tell others that Jim Bidzos was an investor made Consensus Development much more &quot;legitimate&quot;, which also added significant value to us.</p>

<h3>Founding of Alacrity Ventures</h3>

<p>After I left <a href="http://www.certicom.com/">Certicom</a>, the company that had purchased my firm, Consensus Development (see <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html">Bad Business of Fear</a> for more info), I wondered what I should do next. I could theoretically retire if I abandoned the Bay Area, but I was not ready for that and I thought I had maybe enough capital to start one more business of my own instead. Under a non-compete from Certicom, I was not sure what type of non-cryptographic business I wanted to start. So I decided that one thing I could do was some angel investing. In part this was to make money, but a larger part of it was that I enjoyed working with entrepreneurs. I wanted to do for others what Gifford Pinchot had done for me.</p>

<p>I did some study about how venture economics works, how angels and venture capital firms invest, and became concerned. I saw that being an angel investor in many ways is much harder then being a venture capitalist.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges is that angels share all the problems of the institutional investor, of the VC management firm, and of the VC associate.</p>

<p>The first challenge is deciding how much to invest. The institutional investors only risk 1%-5% of their capital. If I limited myself to that amount I could maybe invest in a couple of companies. I decided I was still young and could risk investing more.</p>

<p>The second problem was no management fee -- unlike a VC firm, angels don't get a management fee to cover salaries, legal fees, other expenses. </p>

<p>The third problem was my time. Most angels still work for a living -- being an angel investor is part-time, a venture capitalist typically works full-time. If only 1 in 20 investments &quot;make the fund&quot;, but I could at most manage 7 investments, that meant that I had a 2/3rd's chance of losing my entire investment. I might be able to argue that for some kinds of businesses I might more informed than the average VC, and thus might be able to make better choices, but not <strong><em>that</em></strong> much better.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/harold.jpg" title="Harold" alt="Harold" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />
The key, I decided, was to work with at least 2 other angel investors. That would theoretically allow us to invest in 21 companies, diversify our portfolios, and split the work. I approached my first angel investor, Gifford Pinchot, and he agreed to be one of the partners. The second was <a href="http://www.alacrityventures.com/shattuck.html">Harold Shattuck</a>, who had done some due diligence and operations consulting for Consensus Development, and had been VC once before, but enjoyed being closer to the actual building of a new company with some operating interaction. I was the managing partner for files and accounting, but we all brought to the table our &quot;deal flow&quot;, performed due diligence together, and worked closely with each other.</p>

<h3>Lessons from Alacrity Ventures</h3>

<p>Alacrity Ventures is over 6 years old, and I have learned many lessons from it.</p>

<p>First, I feel that we did a good job selecting our investments, during a time in which being an angel investor was very difficult. I discovered that Gifford, Harold and I were really good at due diligence; our differing skills, Gifford's in coaching and evaluating the management team, Harold's in operations and business models, and mine in technology truly complemented each other.</p>

<p>For a long time I could say that the good news was that that out of 13 investments, all but 1 were still in business. However, we were never able to invest in the 21 investments that we planned because we discovered a significant problem in angel investing: the VC.</p>

<p>The angel investor can only really afford to invest early on, as a seed investor, or in an early investment round such as series A. However, the firms we invested in needed more money along the way; in fact, almost all firms need money at more then one point. The venture climate at the time was such that the VCs required in their term sheets that previous investment rounds lose their <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2004/07/liquidation_pre.html">liquidation preferences</a>, and ultimately their investment.</p>

<p>Let me give a specific example -- we invested in a first round of an enterprise software company in 2000 that is still around today. In 2002 they needed more money, and because of the difficulty in getting VC investment, the lead VC insisted that the preferences from the previous rounds be removed, effectively making us common stock, unless we participated in this subsequent round. We reluctantly did invest some more, but because we don't have the funds that a VC has, we were only able to protect some of our preferred stock. A year and half later, the software company needed more money, and the VC did it again. This time, all our stock was converted to common. Now it is 2006, and the company might be acquired this year; however the VCs, because of their liquidation preferences, will get the first $65 million (or more). As I doubt the firm is worth more then $50M, we will not get anything, nor will any of the other founders that are no longer involved with the firm.</p>

<p>This has repeated itself over and over again. We made a decent choice and did our due diligence well, but subsequent VC investors have pushed us out. A few of our ventures have failed outright. That is understandable given our original 1 in 20 expectations. But what we didn't expect was how difficult it was going to be to participate in the upside. Yes, we had preferences in our early rounds that should have protected us, but they didn't.</p>

<p>So of our 13 investments, only 2 remain that may &quot;make the fund&quot;: a very innovative high-tech titanium powder manufacturer <a href="http://www.itponline.com/">ITT</a>, and a high-tech manufacturer of ceramic devices <a href="http://www.vapore.com/">Vapore</a>. But even as these two investments survive, they are still vulnerable to requiring additional investment and possibly forcing us out.</p>

<p>Of the rest: one of our early investments sold to VeriSign at a 50% premium, our investment in <a href="http://www.salon.com">Salon.com</a> will give us a small return, <a href="http://www.mgtaylor.com">MG Taylor</a> paid off its loan, and <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a> may someday pay back its original investment. The other 8 are being written off as a loss.</p>

<h3>Advice to Angels</h3>

<p>So in spite of the odds, you still want to become an angel investor? Here is some advice...</p>

<p><strong>Collaborate with other angels:</strong> Going it alone is dangerous -- there are a number of angel investor networks, such as <a href="http://gatheringofangels.com/">Gathering of Angels</a>, <a href="http://www.bandangels.com/">Band of Angels</a> and others in listed the <a href="http://www.inc.com/articles/2001/09/23461.html">Directory of Angel-Investor Networks</a>. Be careful, though, the enthusiasm of others can be contagious -- don't always go with the herd.</p>

<p><strong>Do your own due diligence:</strong> I can't emphasize this enough. Talk to the entrepreneurs and meet their staff. Read their business plan and tear it apart. Find the hidden assumptions. Understand their business model. It needs to feel realistic. Try to get more eyes on the job: different people see different things. Don't follow others; they may have different investment criteria then your own.</p>

<p><strong>Be an advisor first:</strong> Be an advisor first -- if the entrepreneurs don't listen to your advice, don't invest. If you have to invest to become an advisor, invest only a small amount, or have part of the money be contingent on a meaningful goal.</p>

<p><strong>Guard your upside:</strong> When negotiating terms, don't worry about the downside. It is the VCs that need items on the term sheet for when things go wrong -- what you need to guard is for when things go right. Watch for changes in the executive staff -- they may be incentivized differently than you are.</p>

<p><strong>Consider a secured loan:</strong> Somewhat contrary to the &quot;guard your upside&quot; advice, rather then investing only in stock, consider investing via a secured loan as well. The security can not only be on hard company assets, but intellectual property such as copyrights, trademarks or patents. Your return will be lower on the loan, but if you can get all of your investment back early and get a small percentage of the company, it can be a good way to balance risk. Just remember to file the property documents to make sure that the assets are properly secured, and be prepared that someday you may own that asset.</p>

<p><strong>Save $2 for every $1:</strong> Almost every company you invest in, even if successful, will need additional funding. Make sure that you keep on hand $2 for every $1 initially invested. This will also help you from being squeezed out by later VC investors.</p>

<p><strong>Invest in acquisition targets:</strong> Let the VCs take companies public -- the companies that you should be interested are the companies that will eventually be acquired. Creating an acquisition target requires the management to think differently -- coach them to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Understand the founders dilemma:</strong> There are many <a href="http://www.businessleader.com/bl/mar01/feature1.html">founders dilemmas</a>, however, one is particularly important to the angel investor. A founder may be incentivized to sell sooner then his early investors. Remember that most often, the only significant asset that a founder has is his company. If the founder has an opportunity to sell early and buy a house, he might, even if it may not be enough return on investment for the risk that the angel took. Find ways to keep your interest aligned with that of the founders, which may include even buying some stock directly from the founder.</p>

<p><strong>Consider alternative exits:</strong> There are lots of boutique opportunities that are too small for VCs. I know of a local Berkeley software company that was number one in their market, but too small to go public. They had $20M in annual revenues, and profits of almost $10M, but little opportunity for growth -- early investors could have gotten their money back in dividends rather than sale of the company.</p>

<p><strong>Time the cycle:</strong> We didn't invest at the ideal time for the angel investor. We picked well considering the times, but had we waited for a few years it would have been easier. Not to say that timing is everything; we'd have lost our titanium powder opportunity if we'd waited for better market timing.</p>

<p><strong>Respect people:</strong> Treat the people you invest in like a paying client. Respect their time and concerns.</p>

<p><strong>Be prepared that the plan will change:</strong> I've never been involved with a business where the business plan doesn't significantly change. As an angel investor you need to help your businesses to plan for those changes.</p>

<h3>Advice to Entrepreneurs</h3>

<p>So you want investment from an angel investor? Some advice...</p>

<p><strong>Recognize the odds:</strong> The angel investor is taking a substantial risk investing in your company -- you need to be able show a scenario where the investor might be able to make 10x or 20x their investment. So if you are looking for $100K, you need to show how the angel can ultimately have stock worth $1M to $2M.</p>

<p><strong>Consider their advice:</strong> Angel investors may not always be right, but show them that you are listening. If you use angels for more then just a source of money, you'll get a lot more value from them.</p>

<p><strong>Draft your business plan:</strong> An angel investor does not need as complete a business plan as a VC does, but they need to see how you think. You should clearly identify what the product or service is, who is going to buy it, what is the marketplace that those buyers may find it in, what differentiates your product or service and why your team is good enough to deliver. Angel investors know that your plan will change, probably drastically, but if they understand your thinking process they can be more confident that your company will survive change.</p>

<p><strong>It takes time:</strong> Don't count on the money from an angel investor (or any investor) until you get the check. Investors are always selecting from a number of choices, often very competitive choices. No matter how optimistic you are, it is likely it will take 6 months or likely more to raise angel money.</p>

<p><strong>Team with Many Hats:</strong> Angel investors don't recruit new team members for you. You don't necessarily have to have your whole team in place, but there at least needs to be someone who has experience managing, someone with development experience, someone with marketing experience, and someone with sales experience. Whatever team is there, they need to be able to juggle all of those hats. Financial, HR, and administrative positions can all be part-time or farmed out.</p>

<h3>Advice to Venture Capitalists</h3>

<p><strong>Value the angel investor:</strong> The angel investor serves a point in the marketplace that you are not able to serve. Rather then driving them out, find some way for them to continue to participate so that they can find other ventures for you.</p>

<p><strong>Angels are not VCs:</strong> The angel investor can't afford to invest in later rounds -- their model is different than yours. It may make sense to force participation in subsequent rounds by other VCs, but carve out some room for angels.</p>

<h3>The future of Alacrity Ventures</h3>

<p>Though I've enjoyed some aspects of being an angel investor, I enjoy working with creative people to innovate new products more. I expect to spend most of my time in the next few years continuing to explore social software and collaboration tools, and the new product opportunities that may evolve from them.</p>

<p>Thus I expect that any future angel investments I make will be more along the lines of Gifford's style of investment in Consensus Development: a small investment of money and a large investment of time. Harold and Gifford both feel the same way. Currently we plan to continue monitoring our existing investments, but don't plan any new investments unless we can take a more active role in the firm -- for instance Harold is a board member in Vapore.</p>

<p>Gifford is now dedicating his life to building a better world by transforming business education. He is a co-founder and President of the <a href="http://www.bgiedu.org">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>, which provides an MBA program integrating sustainability, green economics, the internet, and open source within a traditional MBA program. As an open source school, he helps other schools to use BGI’s curriculum. Check out his blog entry on <a href="http://blogs.pinchot.com/gifsplace/2006/02/angel_philanthr.html">Angel Philanthropy</a>.<br /> </p>

<p>If there's one thing we've learned from six years of angel investing, one thing that may be more valuable than all the nuts and bolts I describe here, it's that Gifford Pinchot's partner-style of angel investment is what suits our investing style, not Jim Bidzos' style of hands-off angel investing, and that's a lesson that we're going to carry forward with Alacrity Ventures.</p>

EXCERPT:
This week has also seen a new topic enter the blog zeitgeist: the topic of reforming or reinventing venture capital. All types of venture investment -- seed, angel, venture, and institutional alike -- carry with it great risks and great rewards. But before we can reinvent venture capital and related venture funding methods like angel capital, we need to understand how it works. (Post continues with discussion of what is venture capital vs angel capital...)

I'm with a company that is more hungry for advice than money. If a company contacted you strictly for the purpose of seeking your advice on building a social network, would you consult with them in exchange for equity?

It depends on the product and the people behind it. Typically I'll charge to offer consulting in areas of my expertise, but offer to reduce my fees in return for equity. If it interests me and it isn't going to take too much time, I will consider offering advice for equity only. If it something that really turns me on, I'll offer to be on an advisory board for equity. So the range of possibilities is pretty broad.

In response to "Angel Philanthropy from Gifs Place"

(Currently in Dublin, Ireland) Was at an excellent presentation a few weeks ago for something which you might consider an angel fund for not-for-profits.

In a nutshell they provide a support and a series of levels where someone with an idea for a not-for-profit can be supported through a variety of levels

Level 1 is designed to help new ideas become real projects. Level 1 is aimed at individuals who are not yet working full time on their projects to help with the running costs. Awards consist of once-off investments

Level 2 is designed to support existing social entrepreneur led projects. Level 2 will include financial support towards the living expenses of award winners allowing them to work full time on their projects. Awards consist of 2 year investments

They support individuals who have a passion for a particular not-for-profit concept rather than an organisation

This post is great.  I am a founder of a start-up that raised some money via the "friends and family" network and are now working on setting ourselves up for another round of capital.  Your comment on being ready for the business plan to change is incredibly true.  Our current model and products (even though not entirely different) is not what they were when we initially started.  BUT I believe that is how a startup grows and better positions itself.  You learn as you go along and work hard to make sure you are constantly improving your business. 

I do have a question about business plans.  We did do an extensive business plan the first time around.  It took me a very long time plus 6 versions to get to that point.  What is your view on how in depth a plan really needs to be?  Should we do a traditional 30 page plus plan or stick to something short and concise that answers the important questions?

Thanks.  Again this post was inspiring.

I'm somewhat torn here on what advice to give. The reality is that the executive summary is the most that most investors will ever see, however, if you make it past that hurdle, the business plan must be a good answer to "how" questions raised by the summary. Also, no "complete" business plan is going to compensate for the basic facts of the business -- do you have a team that has the ability to deliver the product? I've read many good business plans where I was unconvinced the team could execute on it.

Thank you Christopher for discussing your experience as an angel.  This is an important post because is provides detail and data to support the notion that one part of our capital market for creating new companies is broken.  I say broken because there are well-intentioned people (angels, friends and family) that are being invited to invest money in a situation where they really do not understand the risk:  that they are setting themselves up to be crammed down upon the next round of financing.  Some times the people writing the placement memorandums are not making this particular risk explicit and similarly there are entrepreneurs pitching deals that are not proactively addressing this issue - either by telling investors there is a fair change of being crammed down, or taking a strong position on protecting first round investors.

Now, let's say risks are made clear and they are understood.  The entrepreneurs and individuals who manage other people's money are certainly going to do what is in their economic interest.  Hopefully it is clear that the "innovation industry's" long run economic interest just might include respecting the angel class of risk capital.  If not, high net worth investors will find better ways to play; and of course, this is exactly what continues to happen.  Investors who are committed to investing as angels are organizing themselves and their industry.  Founders are understanding the need to protect their friends, family and angel investors by getting them series a preferred stock rather than LLC shares or common stock with warrants; and there are some VCs who are want angels do well as much as they want their fund to be the first capital in.  All this suggests that perhaps the only problem is one of education and awareness, and I am glad that Christopher's post will help provide people both.

Unfortunately, even participating in a Series-A Preferred doesn't protect you -- subsequent rounds of investment can have priority, and often VCs are requiring that previous rounds preferences are removed.

We as Series-A investors as a class could theoretically deny the VC, and probably bankrupt the company. However, in practice that is impossible as enough of the Series-A investors are either committed to the current management team that they'll vote yes, or sufficient of the Series-A investors think that they'll get $0.10 on the dollar vs zero, or sufficient Series-A investors participated in later rounds that they are willing to write-off the Series-A round.

This post was excellent. Getting the chance to walk in the shoes of both the entrepreneur seeking capital and an angel investor managing investments is rare and valuable. 
One thing that can also help entrepreneurs looking at angel investors is understanding the culture of the industry. There's a great podcast at this URL:  http://www.fundinguniverse.com/podcasts/bill-payne2-fundinguniverse.mp3 by the name in angel investing: Bill Payne. He shares what he's learned from his many investing experiences and gives some great info on what to expect as an entrepreneur seeking angel money.

Chris, what a thoughtful, well-considered and accurate post! It's always interesting to see how the paths we wend in life cross and re-cross. [Chris and I first met over 20 years ago in the ferment of the early Mac and online days, when both of us were Sysops on Compuserve, among other things.] For my part I started entrepreneuring in the tech space in the late 1980s, and eventually rode the cycles of booms and busts up and down to great heights and great depths. Along the way I, like you, began angel investing (after my long-suffering spouse refused to let me start another startup :-), with a mix of companies in both the active and passive angel mode. Coincidentally, one of my most active investments is in a network security company, KoolSpan (www.koolspan.com), that is doing some insanely neat stuff you might find of interest.

Also like you, I quickly realized the great benefits of cooperative angel investing, and also started up an angel group, spun out of the erstwhile New York New Media Association. New York Angels (www.newyorkangels.com) has grown over the past several years to over 65 members (including people like Esther Dyson, Alan Patricof, Gideon Gartner and a bunch of other well-known investors) and half a dozen early stage VC funds, who work and play well with us, and value the role that angels occupy in the life-cycle of early stage companies. In the past three years we've invested over $14 million in over 20 companies, which actually brings us close to the scale of a small VC fund (although everyone still decides and funds individually).

However, as you well know, once an entrepreneur, always an entrepreneur, and after several years of sideline-investing, I finally got permission from The Boss to start up another company, and thus, combining both my technical background and my angel background, was created...Angelsoft! For the past two years we've been working on developing a comprehensive platform for supporting angel investors and entrepreneurs, and the result will finally be unveiled next week at the annual summit meeting of the Angel Capital Association, which is being held in New York.

Angelsoft, which is currently in beta with over two dozen angel groups around the world (including that of Bill Payne, who is appropriately cited by the previous commenter as a wonderful resource for angels and entrepreneurs) is a soup-to-nuts solution (www.angelsoft.net/tour) designed specifically to remove as much friction as possible from the angel investment process, and thus help get more investments into more early stage deals. I'll be fascinated to hear your thoughts on it if you get a chance to take a look.

Chris: after reading this post I realized that we had more in common than just our mutual "investment" in MG Taylor. After 20 years of founding and leading companies to either sucessful exit or failed "no-exit", I became a VC partner in a medium size Venture Firm-and after finding the process not to my liking joined the Band of Angels as an early member. I found my experiences on all 3 sides of the early stage investing practice - Entrepreneur/Founder, VC Partner, Angel Investor calibrate well with what you report and advise in your post.

As an active Angel member of the Band of Angels, I spent several years with Matt and Gail Taylor at Knowhere in Palo Alto attempting to learn how to apply many of the processes that were in practice at Knowhere to the due diligence investigation of startup companies. Feeling that we had found a unique way to conduct the practice of investing and managing a portfolio of startups, in late 2000, we opened a venture development "accelerator" called VentureStream fashioned along the lines of the advice you provide in your post.

 - Along with an almost complete committment of the first tranche of a $100 Million Fund, we had aggregated over 100 top-flight advisor/investors to help what we hoped would be a select cadre of successful startups. We built the VentureStream Accelerator with Knowhere-style furniture, hired some of the MGT alumni to help us with the graphical facilitation we were applying to our due diligence and startup investigation process, and partnered with Ernst and Young, who had just bought out their Design Shop license from the Taylors.

I figured with that combination we would have a very promising future.

Our timing on raising $100Million for VentureStream was exactly wrong and so, and as the dotcom bubble began to burst,  we were unable to close on the necessary funding to proceed, and we closed Venturesteam having made only one investment in a spinout partnership from Ernst and Young named RealFoundations. Must have done something right since I just received a very nice cash return on my investment and my ex-partners have gone on to very successful practices themselves. 

LESSON: TIMING IS EVERYTHING - and I should have learned it from my first investor/mentor Sam Bodman(then head of Fidelity Ventures, and now Secy of Energy in Bush's cabinet) Sam said "At a time when feeding frenzy drives the VC industry and startups can get exorbitant first round valuations, and when deals have to be made in "internet time" = that's the time to sit on the sidelines with your money and wait until the bubble bursts.

I think the investment practice of both my previous professional VC partnership and more particularly the Band of Angels was very haphazard and given to very impulsive decision making. I was trying with VentureStream to do better but our timing was not right.  I think both Angels and VCs have it better now that the bubble frenzy has segued into more reasonable valuations and time to do the diligence. However, other than good timing, skillful creation and filtering of prime deal flow and outstanding and continuous project management of the portfolio companies, nothing substitutes for having enough experienced bandwidth in partners/associates/angels as you so wisely point out.

Having left VentureStream five years ago to be an historical footnote on the Wayback Machine, I am content to meander the field of venture philanthropy as a social venture catalyst - seeking to find companies who have that unique hybrid makeup that my friend Jed Emerson calls the Blended Value Proposition. Gifford Pinchot would know what I mean and I would guess you do too.

Thanks for this candid insider account of angel investing from the trench. One thing strikes me as a bit ironic though: if all business plans don't go as planned, why are we fussing about driving it down to details in due diligence, apart from it being a good exercise? I would think that the vision/mission for a venture should stay in the same direction, though the tactics and specific routes to get there tend to develop and adjust over time. Otherwise, you are basically funding a different company than what you originally set out to back, isn't that true? I would argue that companies discarding their original plan rather than just tweaking some details tend to fail more often, or at least having less of a chance of making it really big.

I guess I've heard too much on how the original plan turns out to be something totally different and want to offer a balance: we can and shall still value our in-depth thought put in upfront. There are still high quality ideas to be had at the onset.

A missing middle in funding exists for non-profit social enterprises as well as for-profit ones. What are the underlying causes? If we knew perhaps we could solve the problem in both venture investing and venture philanthropy.

<p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em>[This is the third in a series of articles on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline">Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml">jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml">Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>In our first article on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">collective choice</a> we outlined a number of different types of choice systems, among them voting, polling, rating, and ranking. Since then we've been spending some time expanding upon the systems, with the goal being to create both a lexicon of and a dialogue about systems for collective choice.</p>

<p>This time we're going to dig more into <em>comparison ranking systems</em>, by focusing on <em>competitive</em> rankings and looking more in depth at ELO Chess Ranking System and the other systems that we briefly mentioned previously. Our goal is to explicate these systems, to better address their flaws, to begin detailing the purposes of ranking systems, and to show how those purposes are critical in the design of ranking systems.</p>

<h3><a name="subjective_vs_objective"></a>Subjective vs. Objective Rankings</h3>

<p>In our original article we discussed <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/collective_choi.html">rating systems</a> as being largely subjective and ranking systems as being objective, but the situation isn't nearly as simple as that. In truth, there's a clear spectrum of ratings and rankings with varying amounts of subjectivity and objectivity in each collective choice system. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.bcsfootball.org/"><img border="0" alt="Bcs_1" title="Bcs_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bcs_1.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
<a href="http://www.officialworldgolfranking.com/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/golfrankings_1.png" title="Golfrankings_1" alt="Golfrankings_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) for college football is a good example of a ranking system that explicitly allows a subjective component. It involves a complex mathematical formula that includes things like win/loss ratios, but also sportswriters' and coaches' ratings. </p>

<p>However, public opinion continues to show that people don't necessarily like seeing true ranking systems having subjective components, because they expect them to be &quot;fair&quot;. The BCS formula has come under attack several times in the last few years precisely due to its subjective basis. Cal Berkeley was one of several teams denied a bowl position in 2004 when many felt that they were worthy.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.atptennis.com/en/players/raceleaderboard/rank_definitions.asp">APL tennis rankings</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_rankings">official world golf rankings</a> also have a subjective component, but it is much more subtle. Each tournament is worth a certain number of points, and the allocation of those points is relatively arbitrary, based upon the &quot;prestige&quot; of each tournament and the quality of players who have traditionally played in it. The subjectivism isn't quite as near to the surface as that of the college bowls, but it's still something that can have a notable, and perhaps unwarranted, effect upon the final results.<br /> </p>

<h3><a name="algorithmic_rankings"></a>Algorithmic Rankings</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.kosteniuk.com/"><img border="0" alt="Wcsrating_2" title="Wcsrating_2" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wcsrating_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
This brings us back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system">ELO system</a>, a ranking system originally designed for chess which is fairly well-known and well-understood. As we said in our overview article, &quot;[ELO] builds a simple distribution of player ratings around a norm (typically 1500 points), then awards or deducts points based upon wins and losses, with the total sum of all points in the system staying constant. Players are then ranked according to their comparative scores.&quot;</p>

<p>The big difference between this and the previously discussed systems is that it's almost entirely objective; in fact it uses a statistical basis to create an underlying mathematical model for rankings, rather than allowing human subjectivity to get in the way.<br />

</p>

<p>The simplest formulation for an ELO rating looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span size="+2"><code>R' = R + K * (S - E)</code></span></p>

<p><code>R'</code> is the new rating<br />
<code>R</code> is the old rating<br />
<code>K</code> is a maximum value for increase or decrease of rating (16 or 32 for ELO)<br />
<code>S</code> is the score for a game<br />
<code>E</code> is the expected score for a game</p></blockquote>

<p>Much of the trick is in figuring out what the (<code>E</code>)xpected score of a game is. ELO uses the following formulas for players A and B:</p>

<blockquote><pre>E(A) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [R(B) - R(A)] / 400 ) ]<br />E(B) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [R(A) - R(B)] / 400 ) ]</pre></blockquote>

<p>It's a good model because, using the two formulas, it means that a great player gains little from beating an average player, but an average player gains a lot from beating a great player. Take the following example:</p>

<blockquote><pre>R(A) = 1900<br />R(B) = 1500<br />
E(A) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [1500 - 1900] / 400 ) ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( -400 / 400) ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ -4 / 4 ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ -1 ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / 1 + .1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = .91<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 91%<br /><p>E(B) = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( [1900 - 1500] / 400) ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ ( 400 / 400 ) ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / [ 1 + 10 ^ 1 ]<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 1 / 11<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = .09<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; = 9%</p></pre></blockquote>

<p>Player A is expected to score .91 in an average game, which is to say he should win 91% of the time, and will be punished accordingly if he loses to player B:</p>

<blockquote><pre>R' = 1900 + 32 * (0 - .91)<br />R' = 1900 - 29.12<br />R' = 1871</pre></blockquote>

<p>Conversely a win nets him very little:</p>

<blockquote><p>
R' = 1900 + 32 * (1 - .91)<br />R' = 1900 + 32 * .09<br />R' = 1900 + 2.88<br />R' = 1903</p></blockquote>

<p>ELO is almost entirely mathematical. Players can gain or lose different amounts of points based upon playing different players, but this is all part of the formula. The only slightly subjective element is the definition of <code>K</code> -- how much a player can win or lose from a particular game. The most widely used ELO systems for Chess break <code>K</code> down into two values: 16 for masters and 32 for everyone else. So there is a subjective decision that masters should vary their score less frequently than other players. </p>

<p>That's a very minor element in an otherwise objective system, but as we'll see, more recent systems by Days of Wonder and Microsoft first reduce, then eliminate even this subjectivity.</p>

<h3><a name="days_of_wonder"></a>Variations of a Theme: Days of Wonder</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/"><img border="0" alt="Dowlogo_1" title="Dowlogo_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/dowlogo_1.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
ELO is probably the most used ranking system in the world. You can find it in use for Go, <em>Tantrix</em>, and many other games. Days of Wonder, producers of <em>Gang of Four</em>, <em>Ticket to Ride</em>, and many other games use a variant of the system which they describe on <a href="http://www.gangoffour.com/index.php?t=content&amp;sub=ranking">their website</a>.</p>

<p>They identify three core problems with ELO: </p>

<ol>
<li>New players can take a long time to ascend or descend to their correct levels.</li>
<li>Highly ranked players can be hesitant to play with provisional players whose ranking might be much more uncertain.</li>
<li>There are no allowances for games with more than two players.</li>
</ol>

<p>Days of Wonder resolved the first problem by creating a new formula for provisional players, allowing them to rise and fall in the rankings much more quickly. </p>

<p>Conversely when playing against provisional players, regular players can only lose a maximum of <code>K*n/20</code> points, where n is the number of games that the provisional player has played--rather than the normal maximum loss of <code>K</code>. For example, playing someone who has just played one game, can only result in a loss of 1/20th of the regular <code>K</code> value, and so it really doesn't matter if the provisional player's ranking is wildly out of whack.</p>

<p>Both of these new formulas are set up to converge toward a normal ELO formula as a provisional player's number of games approaches 20 (making them a normal player at Days of Wonder).</p>

<p>(It should be pointed out that using the number &quot;20&quot; to define a provisional player, and making a player less provisional in clean 5% steps, inevitably offers yet another small, subjective element into this mathematical formula; as we'll see momentarily Microsoft has more recently incorporated the idea of provisional uncertainty into their core mathematical model, much as the whole ELO system originally turned subjective win and loss statistics into tighter mathematics.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/wonder/TT/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ttrskotosrankings.png" title="Ttrskotosrankings" alt="Ttrskotosrankings" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
Finally, to resolve the situation of multiple players, Days of Wonder considers each game to be a set of duels, as described here:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
There are 4 players in a </em><em>Gang of Four game. Let's name A the winning player, B the second one, C the third one and D the last one. We consider that there were 6 duels: A won against B, C and D. B won against C and D. C won against D. We compute independently the new scores for each duel, and then we average the values for each player</em>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a fairly elegant answer that not only rewards or penalizes all players separately, but also encourages playing for second place, or even third, if first isn't possible.</p>

<p>There have been continued discussions of the Days of Wonder ELO variant in <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/index.php?t=forums">their forums</a>, and the questions raised there are common to many different ranking systems. Some players wanted unranked games, while others thought that having unranked games would discourage people from playing good competitors <em>except</em> in unranked games.&nbsp; There has also been a lot of discussion regarding <em>Ticket to Ride</em>, a strategy game that supports 2-5 people, and whether the ELO variant system discourages multiperson play.</p>

<p>The various lessons learned at Days of Wonder underline two basic ideas about rankings. First, even with a well-studied system like ELO, there's still a lot to understand, and, second, any ranking system needs to reflect the specifics of what it's ranking -- and what its purpose is.</p>

<h3><a name="xbox_360_live"></a>Variations on a Theme: XBox 360 Live</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/default.aspx"><img border="0" alt="Trueskillxbox360" title="Trueskillxbox360" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/trueskillxbox360.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
An even more recent large-scale ranking system is the <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/displayArticle.aspx?id=1361">TrueSkill</a> system developed by Microsoft for use with the XBox 360. It appears to be an expanded variant of the <a href="http://math.bu.edu/people/mg/glicko/glicko.doc/glicko.html">glicko</a> ranking system used by the <a href="http://www.freechess.org/">free internet chess server</a>.</p>

<p>Many of the problems identified by Microsoft were the same as those already noted by Days of Wonder and others, including: the uncertainty of provisional ratings and the need to rank players in multiplayer games. However, the TrueSkill system notably expands both issues. Ranking uncertainty is now defined as a mathematical concept and the rankings now support not just multiple players, but also multiple teams.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/trueskill.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=430,height=324,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="Trueskill" title="Trueskill" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/trueskill.gif" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>TrueSkill explicitly includes two values in any ranking: a skill level and an uncertainty level. The first, like the more common ELO ranking, tells how good a player is. The second states how sure that ranking is. The uncertainty rating is effectively a margin of error, similar to those we saw in <em>polling systems</em>. If a first-time player has a skill rating of 25 with an uncertainty rating of 8.3 that means that his skill is probably somewhere in the range of 16.7 to 33.3, a pretty wide range, but then this is a totally untested player. According to benchmarks that Microsoft produced, 99.99% of actual skill levels were within 3x of the uncertainty rating, and 100% were within 4x.</p>

<p>The rest of TrueSkill's innovations are built around this model of uncertainty. All players win or lose skill points, based upon how many players they beat or lose to, and they also decrease their uncertainty rating as they play more games. However, uncertainty is decreased more for players toward the middle of a pack within a game than those around the edges (because on the edges the players could actually be much better or much worse than it is possible to see from a specific game). In addition, TrueSkill is only a zero-sum ranking system for players at the exact same level of uncertainty. The more uncertainty that an opponent possesses, the smaller the weighting of any gain or loss (much like the simpler system that Days of Wonder uses, which bases weightings of games against provisional players as <code>n/20</code>).</p>

<p>Overall TrueSkill is a somewhat complex system that is described more fully at Microsoft's <a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/Details.aspx#How_to_Update_Skills">web site</a>. Some of their expansions had already been considered by others, but still their system is notably innovative in two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Expanding a competitive ranking system to include concepts of teams.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporating the uncertainty of ratings further into the core mathematical model, rather than using a somewhat more subjective model such as that described by Days of Wonder for provisional players.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.research.microsoft.com/mlp/trueskill/RankCalculator.aspx"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/trueskillcalculator_1.png" title="Trueskillcalculator_1" alt="Trueskillcalculator_1" class="image-full" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
The TrueSkill calculations are a bit complex. In general, that's not a problem for a computer-based ranking model because you can have a computer doing all the computations, and players only need to understand the results. However the two-part ranking system used by TrueSkill, which notes both skill level and uncertainty, does offer a potential problem on this latter point. <em>Can players understand it?</em> In general, the concept of uncertainty will not be understood by people other that statisticians, thus raising a real user-interface question with the TrueSkill system -- and the exact sort of thing that designers of new ranking systems will need to consider.</p>

<h3><a name="a_tale_in_the_desert"></a>Variations on a Theme: A Tale in the Desert</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.atid.com"><img border="0" alt="A_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1" title="A_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/a_tale_in_the_desert_logo_1.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 The online game, <a href="http://www.atitd.com">A Tale in the Desert</a>, identified a different problem with the ELO system: <em>cheating</em>. This is a uniquely Internet-based problem, because there users can create fake accounts, then defeat those accounts to win points. This can also be done more subtly, by having multiple additional accounts build up the rating of that fake account before the fake account is defeated. So a totally new ranking system, called the <a href="http://wiki.atitd.net/tale1/EGenesis_Ranking_System">eGenesis Ranking System</a>, was created.</p>

<p>Each player is ranked through a 256-bit vector, half of which is initially set to 0 and half of which is set to 1 (therefore creating an average ranking of 128). Whenever a match occurs between players a hash function based on the players' names mathematically selects 32 of those bits, 8 of which are then randomly selected. Among those bits, any 1s in the loser's vector which correspond to 0s in the winner's vector are &quot;transferred&quot;.</p>

<p>This simple design corresponds in some ways to ELO's more complex formula. A good player will have more 1s and thus more to lose, and he will lose correspondingly more to a poor player who has more 0s in his vector. </p>

<p>However, the system also prevents the collusion earlier noted. Statistically, a single player will only ever gain 8 ranking points from another new player, since out of the 32 bit hash only eight of those will, on average, be in the correct 0-1 configuration. Expanding a group of players expands the number of points that can potentially be gained, but within real limits.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/10/dunbar_group_co.html"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wowsocialmap_1.png" title="Wowsocialmap_1" alt="Wowsocialmap_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
In fact, the eGenesis system prevents cheating by measuring the size of social networks, then limiting the number of ranking points that can be earned within a social network. It's not necessarily the only way to measure social network size, but its methodology points toward social software as an interesting area for additional study of ranking systems.</p>

<p>As with XBox's TrueSkill, the eGenesis algorithms are overall fairly sophisticated and confusing, perhaps more so than TrueSkill itself. However, unlike TrueSkill the output is very simple: a skill number between 0 and 255. The intricacies are hidden by the system.</p>

<h3><a name="goals"></a>Competitive Ranking Goals</h3>

<p>Ultimately, as we mentioned when discussing Days of Wonder, any ranking system has to be measured by what it's trying to do and how well it does that. ELO and similar numerical, long-term ranking systems, are most likely trying to achieve one of three goals:</p>

<p><a name="heirarchy"></a><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> Players are divided into hierarchies of success, giving players goals to constantly strive for and ways to measure their success (or failure).</p>

<p><a name="matching"></a><strong>Matching:</strong> Players can play with other players at their same skill level, rather than having to play beginners or experts who are much better than they are. This generally increases everyone's enjoyment. For computer games, the complexity of a matching system can be largely moderated by the computer, thus ensuring better competition.</p>

<p><a name="handicapping"></a><strong>Handicapping:</strong> If players do play against others of different skill levels, the better players can be handicapped in automatic, appropriate ways for the game in question, again increasing the fairness of games and everyone's enjoyment. For instance, someone ranked 3-kyu in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28board_game%29">Go</a> playing a less experienced 7-kyu player would give him a starting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_handicap">4 stone advantage</a> to make for better competition.</p>

<p>The ELO system may be a good matching system, which allows players to easily find other players of their same skill level and play against them. However it doesn't provide any way to handicap players, nor would the ELO method necessarily be a good one to analyze handicaps (and conversely a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_handicap">golf handicap</a> might not do a good job of finding like players nor measuring players' ability in a hierarchy). </p>

<p>More recently the XBox system has stated that it's explicitly for matchmaking, with the goal being to always try and match up players at nearly the same skill level. It's also used for hierarchy (or &quot;leaderboards&quot; as it's described in the TrueSkill docs), but that's clearly a subsidiary purpose.</p>

<p>All of these systems would be ineffective for measuring a winner in a live event, which is a very different goal:</p>

<p><strong>Tourney:</strong> A single player is listed as an absolute winner, the &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. Often, second, third, and fourth place winners are measured too.</p>

<p>And, the systems we've discussed thus far may not be useful for measuring privileges, yet another goal:</p>

<p><strong>Threshold:</strong> The best ranks of players can be given special privileges, including the ability to create games and form tournaments. Alternatively, they can be given privileges totally outside the game, again giving them something extra to strive for.</p>

<p>For each of these additional goals we may need to consider very different ranking systems, not just variations of ELO.</p>

<h3><a name="tourneys"></a>Different Themes: Tourneys</h3>

<p><a href="http://www2.kumc.edu/itc/staff/rknight/tourneys.htm"><img border="0" alt="Tournament_1" title="Tournament_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/tournament_1.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
There are a number of well-known tournament types which can be used to create a &quot;King of the Hill&quot; ranking.</p>

<p>The simplest is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament">single-elimination tournament,</a> where the winner of each competition moves on to compete with other winners, until there is only one. However, this style of tournament is quite cut-throat and is not suited very well to events where the competition may result in a draw, or where chance is a notable factor in the competition. It also has a very subjective factor in the initial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament#Seeding">seeding</a> of the rounds. The single-elimination tournament also does not rank the losers. However, by having the losers compete with each other in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_system_tournament">Swiss-style tournament</a>, the relative strengths of the players can be ranked.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsoo.home.mindspring.com/articles/formats/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/pseudodoubleelimination_1.png" title="Pseudodoubleelimination_1" alt="Pseudodoubleelimination_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
An improvement is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-elimination">double-elimination tournament</a> which is now one of the best known tournament systems in sports. Players compete in series of two-player matches, and a player has to lose twice before he's eliminated. This is done through a system of winner and loser brackets, wherein people drop from the winners' brackets to the losers' brackets when they lose once, and drop out altogether when they lose twice.</p>

<p>One problem with standard double-elimination is that there are unusual situations where a significantly inferior player can still make it to the final round, or the last player to remain undefeated can lose only once and still be eliminated. These can be addressed through variants such as face-off (requiring the last two remaining competitors to compete <em>again</em> if the undefeated team is defeated for the first time in the finals) or by <a href="http://jsoo.home.mindspring.com/articles/formats/">reconfiguring the loser's brackets</a>.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.wscgames.com/"><img border="0" alt="Wsc_1" title="Wsc_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wsc_1.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament">Round-robin tournaments</a>, such as official <a href="http://www.wscgames.com/2005/build/standing/1/topten.html">Scrabble Tournaments</a> involve every player playing a set number of games (24 in the 2005 World Scrabble Championship), facing opponents with similar win-lose records. They then ultimately rank players by their win-lose ratios.</p>

<p>The advantage of these sorts of tournament over an ELO-style ranking is that they're easily understandable and seem fair. In addition, they measure ranking in a much more topical manner: how well someone is playing during a singular instant, rather than over a longer career. As a result they work much better for a live tournament.</p>

<h3><a name="thresholds"></a>Different Themes: Thresholds</h3>

<p>As we discussed in our original article on Collective Choice, thresholds are ranking barriers above which members get a special ability--or alternatively levels below which members lose a special ability. They can also act as another goal for a ranking system.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.usgo.org/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/gosmall.jpg" title="Gosmall" alt="Gosmall" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
In the game of Go there are both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings#Pro_and_amateur_ranks">amateur</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_ranks_and_ratings#Professional_strength">professional</a> players. Although they aren't technically in the same <a href="http://www.cns.nyu.edu/~mechner/go/kyu.html">hierarchy of rankings</a>, the highest Go amateur ranking&nbsp; (7 dan) is approximately equal to the lowest Go professional ranking (1 dan), forming a de facto threshold.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uschess.org/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/uscf_1.png" title="Uscf_1" alt="Uscf_1" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
 Likewise the United States Chess Federation uses their ELO rankings to denote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_master">Chess Masters</a>. Anyone who achieves 2200 UCSF is given a National Master threshold ranking and anyone who maintains it for 300 games is given a Life Master threshold ranking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.acbl.org/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acblopt2_1.gif" title="Acblopt2_1" alt="Acblopt2_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
 The <a href="http://www.acbl.org/">American Contract Bridge Association</a> uses a threshold system where you have to win a certain number of tournaments and thus earn <a href="http://www.acbl.org/about/honorTitles.html">masterpoints</a> in order achieve official rankings such as &quot;section master&quot;. Furthermore, players may earn different &quot;colors&quot; of masterpoints depending the difficulty of the tournament, and some ranks require that you earn at least some specific colored masterpoints in order to meet the requirements for the next threshold.</p>

<p>These thresholds are fairly explicitly based on other hierarchical ranking systems, but this doesn't need to be the case. Since determining the purpose of a ranking system is often the first step in designing it, as we delve further into the area of thresholds we may well find that systems specifically dedicated toward measuring thresholds are more likely to do so well.</p>

<p>In our next article we'll consider among other things the Avogadro reputation system, which manages thresholds in such a way as to prevent cheating.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There's actually a lot of variety in ranking systems, and even though we'd like them to be totally objective, various subjective elements often creep into these systems. In addition, there's a lot of variety in what ranking systems can do. For competitive systems, hierarchy, privilege, matching, and handicapping are some of the top purposes of ranking. Determining what a ranking system is going to do is a necessary first step in designing the system, as different systems will accomplish various goals to a better or worse degree.</p>

<p>ELO, in several variants, is the best studied and most used competitive ranking system. It works particularly well as a matching system. However, even ELO has flaws in it, among them: issues with new player rankings; its core two-player basis; its lack of provisions for teams; a few minor subjective elements; and problems with cheaters. New systems continue to be rolled out on the Internet to resolve these issues, and overall, it's an area of interesting new study.</p>

<p>Tournament systems and threshold systems offer a few good examples of competitive ranking systems with very different purposes, underlying the need to understand what you're doing before you do it.</p>

<p>Ranking systems also lay very near yet another type of Collective Choice: reputation systems. We briefly addressed reputation systems when talking about threshold systems and will return to this in our next article.</p>

EXCERPT:
In our first article on collective choice we outlined a number of different types of choice systems, among them voting, polling, rating, and ranking. Since then we've been spending some time expanding upon the systems, with the goal being to create both a lexicon of and a dialogue about systems for collective choice.

This time we're going to dig more into comparison ranking systems, by focusing on competitive rankings and looking more in depth at ELO Chess Ranking System and the other systems that we briefly mentioned previously. Our goal is to explicate these systems, to better address their flaws, to begin detailing the purposes of ranking systems, and to show how those purposes are critical in the design of ranking systems.

A data point on ELO cheating for you: Yahoo! Games uses ELO rankings for several their two-player games. Before recent abuse mitigation changes, some people used robot to accumulate scores in excess of 6,000,000 points. The abuse-the-ranking game had become a totally seperate competition.

For now, Yahoo! has capped the ELO scores at 3,000 (I think.) This removed most of the cheating incentive.

In the slashdot discussion of this blog entry http://games.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=173988&threshold=0&mode=flat   there was an interesting link to beatpaths.com, which is sort of a tourney system for when you can't complete a full set of round-robin or double-elimination competitions, as what happens in NFL during the fall season.

What is also interesting to me is that it introduces a goal for ranking systems that I'd not thought of before -- prediction. The purpose of the beatpath systems is actually focused on predicting the outcome the next set of the weekend games.

There's a ranking scheme that Mark Newman from the U of Michigan did for college football, which Yahoo Search turned up a pointer to here:

http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20051112/mathtrek.asp

quoting:

Physicists Juyong Park and M.E.J. Newman aimed for a ranking system that's fast and easily understood by fans (in contrast to the cumbersome, opaque BCS formula). They based their ranking method on the notion that, if A beats B, and B beats C, then A also beats C, even if it may not actually play C. Hence, the method counts both direct wins by beating a team and indirect wins by beating a team that beat another team.

(end quote)

You end up with a directed graph of teams as nodes and games as edges, and compute a function of that graph that is related to a centrality metric.

This article is a great survey of the subject!  I'm working on the PvP ranking system for another game with some unique problems, because the teams in a PvP match can be of disparate size and widely differing power levels, which are then balanced so that wildly mismatched teams (ignoring relative rank at PvP for the moment) are actually reasonably matched.

The blog run by Christopher Allen, Life with Alacrity, has an excellent article on ranking systems (as well as a number of other articles that are well worth reading).

They do mention cheating as a problem, particularly in online systems.

<p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em>[This is the second of a series of articles on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">collective choice</a>, co-written by my collegue <a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline">Shannon Appelcline</a>. It will be <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_179.phtml">jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml">Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.]</em></p>

<p>In our previous article we talked about the many systems available for <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html">collective choice</a>. There are <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#selection_systems">selection systems</a>, which are primarily centered on voting and deliberation, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#opinion_systems">opinion systems</a>, which represent how voting could occur, and finally <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#comparison_systems">comparison systems</a>, which rank or rate different people or things in a simple, comparative manner.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="128" border="0" alt="Stars_1" title="Stars_1" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/stars_1.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>One purpose of our previous article was to create a dictionary of terms for talking about these related, but clearly different, systems. Another was to start offering analyses of these systems, many of which had not been well studied before their introduction onto the Internet. </p>

<p>However at best our previous article provided an overview of what should be further investigated in each system. This article provides more in-depth coverage of one of the systems we previously outlined: <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#rating_systems">rating systems</a>.</p>

<p>As we wrote in our previous article, in comparison rating systems <em>&quot;the value of individual items (most frequently goods) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users.&quot;</em> Ratings systems should be clearly differentiated from the closely related <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/12/systems_for_col.html#ranking_systems">ranking systems</a>. Ratings systems have a more subjective component, while ranking systems are largely objective. Amazon, Netflix, BoardGameGeek, and even the Stock Market were offered up as examples of ratings systems. Another example of a comparison rating system, and one of the earliest that appeared on the modern Internet, is eBay. The techniques they use are now beginning to show their age.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>eBay: A Failed Rating Experiment</h3>

<p><img border="0" alt="Ebaysales" title="Ebaysales" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebaysales.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" />Most rating systems center around rating content, often user-contributed content, and they frequently help apply community values and acclaim to that content. However, the idea of ratings can go far beyond that narrow niche (though that will doubtless be its greatest use as the Internet continues to expand). Early Internet site, <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>, was one of the first to widely use user-submitted ratings, and it used them for a different manner: to determine the good traders on their auction site.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as one of the first in this field, eBay made many mistakes which now leave their ratings system only slightly helpful. However, its failures can also provide us with insights in creating new rating systems on the Internet.</p>

<p>eBay allows you to leave positive, negative, or (more recently) neutral feedback for each transaction you conduct in their society. These are aggregated into two numbers. &quot;Feedback Score&quot; is calculated as unique positive feedback received minus unique negative feedback received, and results in a whole number like &quot;32&quot; or &quot;10,302&quot;. &quot;Positive Feedback&quot; is calculated as positive feedback received divided by all feedback received, and results in a percentage like &quot;100%&quot; or &quot;99.8%&quot;.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for reasons discussed below, almost all feedback is positive, and thus the Feedback Score acts almost entirely as a track record of how many trades someone has made. The Feedback Score could be largely replaced by that single number. You can look at a score of &quot;27&quot;, and say, &quot;That's an amateur trader, or someone just getting started&quot;, at a score of &quot;3&quot;, and say, &quot;That person may or may not know what they're doing&quot;, at a score of &quot;10,302&quot;, and say, &quot;That person has done a lot of trades.&quot; But you still don't know how good the trader is.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayprofile.jpg" title="Ebayprofile" alt="Ebayprofile" class="image-full" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Theoretically, the Positive Feedback percentage should give a more meaningful number, but people so infrequently give bad ratings that, even when they do appear, they look like noise. Does a percentage of &quot;99.8%&quot; on a user with a score of &quot;1,762&quot; mean that the seller has a genuine problem or not? Do those 3 unhappy customers really represent another 30 who were unwilling to actually click the negative feedback? And, did those people have slightly bad experience or really bad experiences? It's pretty hard to say.</p>

<p>Overall, eBay has a few major problems with their rating system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It's <strong>non-granular</strong>, with only two options (positive/negative), or more recently three (positive/negative/neutral).</p></li>

<li><p>It's <strong>non-distinct</strong>, with no useful guidelines on what behaviors should result in each rating.</p></li>

<li><p>It's <strong>non-statistical</strong>, and thus ends up showing only a gross number of sales, not a real subjective measure.</p></li>

<li><p>It's <strong>bilateral</strong>, with buyers and sellers rating each other simultaneously, and thus people are afraid to give bad ratings lest they get them in return.</p></li>

<li><p>It's <strong>meaningless</strong>, because there are no good tools to control who bids on an auction based on Feedback numbers. (Technically it may be legitimate to ban low feedback bidders from an auction, then cancel their bids if they enter the auction, but this is neither obvious, automatic, nor simple.)
</p></li></ul>

<p>We're going to address each of these issues in turn, to offer insight into creating new comparison rating systems. The first three topics--granularity, distinction, and a statistical basis--are the most important elements of a good comparison rating system. Bilateral &amp; meaningfulness issues will only be relevant on certain sites.</p>

<p>(As a final caveat: in some ways eBay falls closer in ultimate result to a <em>reputation system</em>, a topic which we'll be covering more in a few articles down the road, but its lessons learned are still entirely accurate for rating systems of all sorts.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Granular Ratings</h3>

<p><img border="0" alt="Smiley" title="Smiley" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/smiley.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" />
In general, <em>people want to be nice</em>. There are exceptions to that rule, perhaps even great numbers of them, but the average, well-adjusted person would prefer to make other people happy, not sad.</p>

<p>This has a notable effect on any comparison rating system, because it means that people are less likely to use the bottom half of any rating scale. If you did a statistical run on eBay, you'd certainly find that more than 99 out of every 100 ratings are positive. This is largely influenced by concerns of bilateral revenge, as discussed below, and the fact that eBay suggests other means of dispute resolution when you try and leave negative feedback. However, <a href="http://www.rpg.net">RPGnet</a>, a roleplaying site which reviews games, comics, books, movies, and more shows a similar trend despite the lack of bilaterality.</p>

<p>RPGnet uses two 5-points scales for reviews, resulting in a total rating of 2-10. Of all the ratings at RPGnet, 6,983 reviews have a total that's above average, a total rating of 6 or more, and 795 have a total that's below average, a total rating of 5 or less. Perhaps there are more people who sit down to write a review because they really like a game than those who do so because they really hated it, but the result of ~90% of reviews being above average is still stunning.</p>

<p>The following table shows all the ratings for each of the two categories that RPGnet uses, &quot;Style&quot; and &quot;Substance&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/9/9971.phtml"><img border="0" alt="Rpgnetsettlersreview" title="Rpgnetsettlersreview" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/rpgnetsettlersreview.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 15px 5px; float: right;" /></a>

<td>23.8%</td>
</tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>This evidence confirms what we'd already suspected. Only 10% of raters use the bottom two ratings in a 5-point scale, and only 2% use the bottom rating. The median of the 5-point scale is actually the fourth point, with a neat bell curve arranged around it.</p>

<p>Because users are innately unwilling to give bad ratings, as evidenced here, useful comparison ratings truly come about only through fractional differences between good ratings. In this case, the difference between &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, and &quot;5&quot; is meaningful, and becomes more meaningful as more ratings are entered. Eventually you can look at a ranked list of ratings and see that &quot;4.2&quot; is a good rating while &quot;3.5&quot; is not.</p>

<p>In order to do this, however, you need enough levels of good ratings to be able to distinguish between them. eBay, only offering one positive rating, does not provide enough differentiation. RPGnet, with its three positive ratings, might. However, sites that offer a 10-point scale are the ones that really seem to be able to produce meaningful statistics. On those sites we can expect that 90% of users will choose between six different numbers, from &quot;5&quot; to &quot;10&quot;, and as the number of ratings builds up, this will produce enough differentiation to be meaningful. If you have already adopted a 5-point scale, consider allowing users to select the half-points, giving users a greater ability to differentiate their ratings.<br /> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Distinct Ratings</h3>

<p>No two users are ever going to rate the same; different rating numbers will mean different things to each person. This can introduce minor discrepencies into ratings, if a single individual rates particularly low or high. However, because most ratings are eventually used for comparisons, if that low- or high-rater rates many different things, the ratings equalize. &quot;Item A&quot; is rated low by this person, but so is &quot;Item B&quot;, and so they end up in the correct positions <em>in relation to each other</em>.</p>

<p>A bigger problem occurs when an individual is inconsistent in his ratings over time. If an individual rates everything low for a while, then rates everything high, then he has a greater chance of biasing the overall rating pool. Worse, his individual ratings aren't meaningful, because you can't look at two items, see that one is a &quot;6&quot; and another is an &quot;8&quot;, and truly believe that he likes the &quot;8&quot; a fair amount more than the &quot;6&quot;. This reduces the usability of an individual recommendation system or a friends system where one user might look at what other users thought about products, because their unaggregated numbers are not accurate.</p>

<p>You thus want to help individuals to stay consistent, and the best way to do that is to make the criteria for your ratings distinct. <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com">BoardGameGeek</a>, a board game web site that supports a 10-point rating system for games, does a good job of offering distinction in its ratings. </p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/13"><img border="0" alt="Settlers_rating_1" title="Settlers_rating_1" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/settlers_rating_1.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>

</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>10</strong> - Outstanding. Always want to play and expect this will never change.</li>
<li><strong>9 </strong>- Excellent game. Always want to play it.</li>
<li><strong>8 </strong>- Very good game. I like to play. Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game.</li>
<li><strong>7 </strong>- Good game, usually willing to play.</li>
<li><strong>6 </strong>- Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood.</li>
<li><strong>5 </strong>- Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it.</li>
<li><strong>4 </strong>- Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion.</li>
<li><strong>3 </strong>- Likely won't play this again although could be convinced. Bad.</li>
<li><strong>2 </strong>- Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again.</li>
<li><strong>1 -</strong> Defies description of a game. You won't catch me dead playing this. Clearly broken.</li></ul></blockquote>

<p>If you offer a distinct rating listing like this, some users will still come up with their own rating ideas, but if they do, they're more likely to remember what each number means to them. For everyone else, a very clear, s rating system is the most likely to produce meaningful and consistent results. As long as users aren't puzzled by the distinction, they'll be consistent in picking the same numbers for the same rating every time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Statistical Ratings</h3>

<p>The last big topic that you have to think about in creating most comparison rating systems is whether they're statistically sound. </p>

<p>The best way to make your ratings statistically sound is with volume. If you can manage thousands or tens of thousands of ratings for each item, any anomolies are going to become noise. However, the fewer ratings you have, the more likely it is that your ratings are inaccurate in relationship to your database of ratings as a whole. (And thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings, where there's clearly no statistical basis.)</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes"><img border="0" alt="Bayes" title="Bayes" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/bayes.jpeg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Ideally what you want to do is give items with fewer ratings among your collection less weight, and those with more ratings higher weight. One simple way to do this is to apply a <em>bayesian average</em>. Variants of this are used by the aforementioned BoardGameGeek and by <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>. RPGnet is using it for some unreleased software as well.</p>

<p>The idea behind a bayesian average is that you normalize ratings by pushing them toward the average rating for your site, and you do that more for items with fewer ratings than those with more ratings. The basic formula looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><code> b(r) = [ W(a) * a + W(r) * r ] / (W(a) + W(r)]</code>

</p>

<p><code>r</code> = average rating for an item<br /><code>W(r)</code> = weight of that rating, which is the number of ratings<br /><code> a</code> = average rating for your collection<br /> <code>W(a)</code> = weight of that average, which is an arbitrary number, but should be higher if you generally expect to have more ratings for your items; 100 is used here, for a database which expects many ratings per item<br /><code>b(r)</code> = new bayesian rating </p></blockquote>

<p>Say three &quot;shill&quot; users had come onto your site and rated a brand new indie film a &quot;10&quot; because the producer asked them to. However, you use a bayesian average with a weight of 100, and thus 3 ratings won't move the movie very far from the average site rating of 6.50:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>b(r) = [100 * 6.50 + 3 * 10] / (100 + 3)<br /> b(r) = 680 / 103<br /> b(r) = 6.60</code></p></blockquote>

<p>WowWebDesigns uses a similar model and even offers a <a href="http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/formula.php">good explanation of their methods</a> on their web site.<a href="http://www.wowwebdesigns.com/designs/id_242/ratings/"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/wowwebdesignsrating.png" title="Wowwebdesignsrating" alt="Wowwebdesignsrating" class="image-full" halign="middle" style="margin: 5px;" /></a>
</p>

<p>With everything that's been described thus far, including granularity and distinction, a bayesian average (or some other similiar method) will probably be enough to give your ratings a good, sound statistical basis. However, sites with low volume of ratings may still be concerned with &quot;shills&quot; or &quot;crappers&quot; who come in to your site just to put &quot;10&quot;s on their favorite items on &quot;1&quot;s on their least favorite. RPGnet's reviews are an example of a site that could experience this issue, because only a few people are going to ever write reviews for an individual item, and this small number of reviews could compromise the nature of any comparisons generated by the ratings sytems.</p>

<p>In short summary the following additional methods may help with this issue:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rate the Raters:</strong> Reviews are low volume, but presumably readers of those reviews are high volume, and you can take advantage of that to then have your readers rate the reviews. <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> are two examples of sites which use this method by asking &quot;how many readers found this helpful&quot;.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Altruistic Punishment:</strong> An alternative method for rating raters is to use <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html#altruistic_punishment">altruistic punishment</a>. Herein users can punish someone who does contribute to the community, but at a cost to themselves. So, a reader could flag a poor rating or a poor review at some minor cost to their own rating. Though this method may seems somewhat paradoxical, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>&nbsp; suggests that it is a generally effective technique for improving the commons.</p>

</li>

<li><p><strong>Adjust Ratings Based on Ratings:</strong> Ratings can be self-adjusted based upon the rater's own behavior. The simplest method here is to map a rater's average rating to the average rating for a site. For example, if the average rating of a site is 6.50 and a shill's average rating is 10.0, then those 10s should be treated as 6.50s. This has the possibility for some intensive calculations, however, and may lead to additional bias in your rating pool if shills figure out the methods you use to adjust ratings.
</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Allow Editorial Fiat:</strong> Another method is to allow editorial fiat, where editors are expected to come in and remove bad ratings (or proactively not release them). This clearly results in time issues, but they may not be major since only sites with small numbers of ratings/item will have to do this type of adjusting. Further, automated systems could flag &quot;suspicious&quot; rating patterns which are outside the norms for average, speed of rating, etc. (RPGnet supports editorial fiat by requiring editorial release of all reviews.)</p></li></ul>

<p>The idea of adjusting ratings based on ratings bears a bit of additional discussion because it's somewhat similar to another well-knowing rating system: slashdot. Herein you have both ratings and meta-ratings. People can rate threads and articles, then other people can agree or disagree with those ratings, which in turn makes it more or less likely that the original rater will be allowed to rate in the future (depending on if people agree or disagree with his ratings). Under a more general classification, this is probably a <em>meta-rating system based on a reputation system</em>, so it's something we'll look at further a couple of articles down the road.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Other Issues: Bilateralism &amp; Usefulness</h3>

<p>90% of the rating issues that sites will face are covered by the above. However eBay in particular raised two other issues -- bilateralism and usefulness -- that aren't as generally relevant but do deserve some consideration.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ebayfeedback.jpg" title="Ebayfeedback" alt="Ebayfeedback" class="image-full" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
Bilateralism:</strong> One of the reasons that eBay's ratings fall apart is that they're bilateral. Buyers and sellers rate each other simultaneously and thus there's the fear of revenge if you rate someone badly. It's a sufficient issue that eBay has a <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/feedback/questions/retaliatory-feedback.html">FAQ on the topic</a>, though they don't offer any good answers. </p>

<p>The following solution would address some issues of bilateral revenge:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Put a time limit on bilateral ratings</p></li>
<li><p>Release bilateral ratings simultaneously at the end of the time limit</p></li>
<li><p>Don't allow additional ratings after the time period</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This would work well on an eBay, where you're unlikely to conclude an additional deal with someone you rated badly, and thus there's no possibility ever for rating revenge. On a game site, however, where people are arbitrarily put into games with each other, and thus you could end up in a game with someone you rated poorly, there might be room for later revenge, down the road. This would have to be addressed to truly feel comfortable with bilateral ratings. </p>

<p>Additional investigation might reveal more variations of this method, or offer good answers for alternatives, like <em>anonymous ratings</em>.</p>

<p>In addition, good privacy restrictions are really needed to make bilateral ratings work, as well as Terms of Service that protect users from lawsuits for ratings. There have already been cases of physical threats based upon eBay ratings. eBay has also produced cases where people threatened slander or libel lawsuits for bad ratings, and this even further chills the possibility of true ratings appearing on the eBay server.</p>

<p><strong>Usefulness:</strong> Finally, you want to make sure your ratings are useful at your sites. Rankings are a good way to achieve this. You can see the &quot;best games ever&quot; ranked, or you can see the most interesting user content rise to the top of a long listing, and the least interesting sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>eBay offers a counter example of frustration with the usefulness of ratings. As already mentioned, you can theoretically ban &quot;bad&quot; users from bidding on your items, and then cancel bids from these users if they appear. However, there are multiple issues with this approach. First, how do you define &quot;bad&quot; users on eBay? Insufficient feedback? Too much negative feedback? Too high a percentage of negative feedback? Second, there is no automated method for doing this, so you must remain ever vigilant on your auctions to make sure that &quot;bad&quot; users aren't involved. Third, there's no way to keep a bad bidder from returning after you've cancelled his bid. Fourth, these bad bids and cancellations have the possibility of corrupting your auction, as you could lose other bidders who came in, saw the higher bid when the bad bidder was involved, then left before the bid was reduced by his removal. Finally, greed is a powerful motivator on eBay, which might lead to the retention of bad users.</p>

<p>You also need to be careful with your user interface for ratings. Here is an example of a poor UI:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/uselessratingui.jpg" title="Uselessratingui" alt="Uselessratingui" />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Comparison ratings are going to be an increasingly important force as the Internet continues to mature. To produce meaningful comparison ratings for your site, you need to concentrate on four important factors: granularity, specifity, sound statistics, and usefulness. And, if you offer bilateral ratings, make sure you understand the subtleties of that as well.</p>

I've ran into my fair share of voting systems, but by far the worst I've ever seen is the one used at www.animenfo.com, a database of anime products with user ratings. When giving a product a rating, a user is required to also write a constructive review on the product. However, the reviews are moderated and, often, removed from the database as "unconstructive" by the limited number of moderators. The problem with this approach is that the moderators are inevitably biased. A submitted, bad rating on a product, if reviewed by a moderator who personally likes the show being rated, is often removed from the database with the claim that the review was not constructive. Perhaps not entirely related, but an example of ratings-gone-awry, all the same.

It's rarely used, but asking people to rank from -5 to +5 can be better than ranking from 0 to 10.   You make it very clear that "0" means average/neutral.   You won't entirely eliminate the positive bias in ratings but you can reduce it.  And you bring everybody closer to the same mean.

I've concluded over time that in fact the response to a negative feedback on eBay should be disabled, as it contains no information.   Who, after all, is going to give a positive feedback to somebody after they have slapped a negative on you?  The likely choices there are no-feedback or neutral from a charitable person and of course a revenge negative.

So they could make it simpler.  If the first person gives a negative, the transaction is considered sour.  In your stats it would list the number of first-negatives you left for others.  (The number of negs you leave for others is already visible but harder to find.)  Ideally split buyer/seller.

An interesting point missing from this good summary:

Many huge ratings sites see a clear bimodal distribution of scores when rating products(movies, cds, books, etc.)  with a simple scoring scheme, such as a single 5-star scale: The nodes are at 1 and 5 stars, with the love-or-hate scores making up more than 80% of all scores.

Clearly, some of that is a function of the intrinsic cost vs. incentive structures of completing ratings and reviews. When there is a clear direct benifit to the user (such as Netflix, Slashdot, or Yahoo! Music's Launchcast) ratings tend to distribute a bit more evenly (but just a bit.)

My point is that the actual end-user application of the rating has a large effect on the nature of the scores that will be created.

I find when people give a bad rating on anything from eBay to those hotel and restaurant review sites its usually as a result of an extremely negative personal experience therefore the rating tends to be exagerated and totally not objective. 

A blind system like the porposed solution to eBay bilateralism issue is probably best. 

I've been a mystery shopper for a handful of restaurants and the system works quite well. In this system the purpose is to behave exactly like a regular consumer. You sit down, ask about the specials, take mental note of everything from the bathroom sink to the temperature of the food (and a hundred other details), but you don't behave in any way that would alter the staff you are a mystery shopper (for example writing things down is strickly prohibited).

Upon returning home you complete a lengthy questionnare about all the details you were supposed to notice. In this system the rewards is for a thorough assesment, regardless of its positive or negative slant. The more detail you provide the better assignments you get next time around. Even if you totally slam a place, but you provide substantial detail, you will be "promoted" to a "bar visit" or something much more rewarding than the typical lunch visit. So, I also agree with this articles suggestion to rate the raters, akin to what Amazon does but without the bias towards volume.

I would also addd that there is no middle ground on such ratings. Whether the choices range from Strongly Agree to Strongly Dissagree, or from "shortest wait" to "longest wait" there is no 'neutral' choice, nothing is "just right" as in the story about the three bears and the porridge. Even with numerical choices they are always even, not odd, so there is not chance of ranking in the middle. I like that. I think it pushes you to be more realistic. Having a middle ground leaves the undecided the opportunity to not make a decision. A "middle" rating is of no use to anyone.

Good work there, and very thorough. Can we distinguish the social/transactional from the object/informational aspects of a rating situation? I'm just wondering aloud. On the one hand is the fact that publishing one's rating of a transaction will reflect on the transaction partner, on oneself, and so is social. On the other hand is the fact one can indeed rate an experience with some objectivity, assuming that the soft stuff has been bracketed out. I dont see how we can bracket out the social though, at least in a way that users will be able to participate in. 
There's a thing about sincerity as a type of interaction: it's an attribute of expression that cannot be stated explicitly (say that you're being sincere and you throw your sincerity into quesion immediately). Ratings may fall into that kind of category of linguistic and metalinguistic acts..

Wow, thorough and cogent. 

Of all of the points, one missed opportunity occured to me while reading, and that is on the EBay statistical validity criticism. The phrase 'thus one of the failures for eBay is that it tries to claim meaningfulness for users with very few ratings, where there's clearly no statistical basis' struck me as off.

Human transactions are not mechanical actions - they involve situations that often matter. Hence a particular negative may really be cause for serious concern, even if there are not yet many ratings. Also, beginners are not inherantly less important than experienced traders. So though difficult, credit, or blame, is rightly awarded even on the basis of just a few transactions. Exactly how is a subject of further refinement.

I have read some of the EBay dissection papers a while back. This post is far more comprehensive, that is wide ranging, and yet not missing clarity, accuracy or nuance. Master work.

BODY:
<p><span style="font-size: 0.7em;">by Christopher Allen &amp; Shannon Appelcline</span></p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.skotos.net/about/staff/shannon_appelcline">[Shannon Appelcline</a> is a friend and colleague of mine at <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos</a>, an online game company. Over the last few years we've had many discussions about how decisions are made, and how our society collectively makes choices. The origin of these discussions have varied from &quot;what makes this board game work?&quot;, to &quot;how can we give our players more control of our online games?&quot;, to &quot;how do we make decisions in our company?&quot;, and of course &quot;how did we collectively make such a mess of decision making in America?&quot;. This article, and some followup articles, summarize our thoughts on these topics, and will be <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_178.phtml">jointly posted</a> in Shannon's <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT.shtml">Trials, Triumphs &amp; Trivialities</a> online games column at Skotos.]</em></p>

<p><img border="0" alt="Peoplearoundthesun" title="Peoplearoundthesun" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/peoplearoundthesun.gif" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /> Collective choice systems have been around for a long time. Since at least the birth of democracy in ancient Greece people have made joint decisions about important issues, and since at least the knightly tournaments of the late Middle Age people have competed to be ranked against their peers. Today Western culture especially values diversity of input when implementing any type of choice, believing that wide input from a variety of people provides the fairest result.</p>

<p>The Internet expands this long history of collective choice. However, as we bring collective choice systems onto the Internet, quantifying and programming them, we discover the need to be more analytical and more methodical in the techniques used. Thus we're beginning to learn that we don't know nearly as much about these collective choice systems as we should. There is a need to analyze and study them further, to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and to evaluate their social impact. Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/tracing_the_evo.html">social software</a> and online games on the Internet provides the perfect <em>petri dish</em> for doing so.</p>

<p>Before any analysis can occur, however, there is a need for a categorization of systems and a definition of terms. That is the purpose of this article: to lay out at least some of the ways in which collective choices can be made, to organize them, to define them, and to briefly consider them. </p>

<p>Broadly, there seem to be three methods of collective choice, divided by the intended result: <em>selection</em>, <em>opinion</em>, or <em>comparison</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="selection_systems">Selection Systems</a></h3>

<p>Selection systems allow for the purposeful choice between multiple items. There are many types of selection systems, but two in particular, <em>representative systems</em>, <em>deliberative systems</em>, and <em>consensus systems</em> are worth noting.</p>

They're by definition <em>voting systems</em> and the heart of any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism">Republican</a> system of government. When you're voting for a president, prime minister, senator, congressman, director, or board member, that's representative voting</p>

<p>In most representative voting a winner is selected by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality">plurality</a>, meaning the winner had more votes than any other candidate. This works well in a simple two-member election, but begins to fall apart if there are multiple candidates, because similar candidates can steal votes from each other, and thus allow a candidate with less popular ideas to be elected.</p>

<p>The simplest solution is to require a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority">majority</a> victory, meaning that one winner must have at least 50% of the votes. Some places in the United States use this system for their representative elections, holding a first election, eliminating all but the two biggest vote-getters, then holding a new election between these two.</p>

<p>Another solution is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election">primary-based election system</a>, wherein all like-minded candidates compete against each other before participating in the real election. This requires buy-in from all like-minded candidates, however, and recent U.S. elections with third-party candidates like Ralph Nader and Ross Perot show the flaws in a voluntary primary system.</p>

<p>Many other types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_systems">voting systems</a> are possible, most of which allow voters to select multiple candidates at the same time. These systems then eliminate the lowest ranked candidates and give their votes to others based upon those voter selections. </p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/irv.gif" title="Irv" alt="Irv" style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;" /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRV">Instant Runoff Voting</a>, or IRV, is a fairly commonly used multiple candidate system (though not necessarily the best one). It's technically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Transferable_Vote">single transferable vote</a> preferential voting system. Wikipedia describes the process like this:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Each voter ranks at least one candidate in order of preference.<br /> ...<br /> First choices are tallied. If no candidate has the support of a majority of voters, the candidate with the least support is eliminated. A second round of counting takes place, with the votes of supporters of the eliminated candidate now counting for their second choice candidate. After a candidate is eliminated, he or she may not receive any more votes.</em></p>

<p><em>This process of counting and eliminating is repeated until one candidate has over half the votes.</em></p> </blockquote>

<p>It's simple to understand, but also flawed. That's because every voting system ultimately has <em>some</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">flaw</a> in it, as is evidenced by the fact that given the same conditions the different systems will often declare different winners. Different systems may also allow voters to &quot;game&quot; the system in different ways. This is often called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting">tactical voting</a> or strategic voting. Similar to analyzing various &quot;attacks&quot; when studying a cryptosystem, looking at which tactical voting approaches each voting system is vulnerable to helps you evaluate the voting systems.</p>

<p>For instance, one type of tactical voting that can be used against an Instant Runoff Vote is the push-over strategy, which Wikipedia describes as this:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Push-over is a type of strategic voting in which a voter ranks a perceived weak alternative higher, but not in the hopes of getting it elected. This primarily occurs in runoff voting when a voter already believes that his favored candidate will make it to the next round - the voter then ranks an unpreferred, but easily beatable, candidate higher so that his preferred candidate can win later. A United States analogy would be voters of one party crossing over to vote in the other party's primary to nominate a candidate who will be easy for their favorite to beat.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>For example, in an IRV election between Bush, Gore, and Nader, Democrats might rank Nader over Bush. The hope would be that this would give Nader enough votes to keep him from being eliminated, thus knocking Bush out instead in the first round. Afterward the Republican Bush votes transfer to the less progressive Gore, rather than the fringe Nader, allowing Gore to beat the &quot;pushover&quot; Nader when they couldn't have faced Bush in a straight-up fight.</p>

<p>There several different tactical voting &quot;attacks&quot; against various representative voting systems. One of the technically better multiple-candidate voting methods is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">condorcet method</a> for voting. It's immune to most tactical voting strategies and more people would consider its result &quot;correct&quot;, but unfortunately it is much harder on the voters, who have to rank every single candidate. Maybe if we can create a better Internet user-interface to condorcet voting we can make this more sophisticated representative voting system more broadly available.</p>

<p><strong><a name="deliberative_systems">Deliberative Systems:</a></strong> In a deliberative system, individuals directly make a decision, rather than selecting a representative to do so. Deliberative systems do <em>not</em> have to include voting, and the subcategory of <em>consensus systems</em> described below technically don't, however most modern deliberative sytems do. A deliberative system is the heart of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEMOCRACY">true democracy</a>. Traditionally it's been relatively unfeasible because voters were not expected to be educated enough to make governmental decisions and because they didn't have the time or capability to regularly decide on issues. The spread of the Internet alleviates at least the latter problem, since millions of people can now simultaneously decide on any issue if they so desire.</p>

<p>In the United States the best known deliberative system is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative">initiative</a> system found in some states, including California. It allows for issues to be put directly before the voters through the submission of sufficient signatures, and then allows the voters to pass or fail those issues, based on either <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality">plurality</a> (most votes), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority">majority</a> (at least 50% of votes), or else <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority">super majority</a> (some percentage of votes in excess of 51%). In California, for example, 66% approval is required for new tax initiatives.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/constitution_signing.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=540,height=350,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="129" border="0" alt="Constitution_signing" title="Constitution_signing" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/constitution_signing.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The United States constitution defines a large and very complex deliberative system. It creates three bodies of government to support deliberation and voting, and uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checks_and_Balances#Checks_and_balances">checks and balances</a> systems in order to allow different branches to have different effects upon a vote. The main voting is done by the legislature, which requires two <em>pluralities</em> from two different groups of people to pass a vote. Then the executive branch has a singular opportunity to veto legislature, which then requires a <em>super majority</em> (here, 66%) to override that veto. Once a law is established, the judicial department may by <em>plurality</em> vote to declare that legislation unconstitutional, but that may be overcome by an even greater <em>super majority</em> (typically, 66% of each legislature + 75% of the state governments) who want to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution#Provisions_for_amendment">amend the constitution</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The constitution also shows how deliberation can span beyond simple voting because of the fact that it includes specific rules for how to debate, when debate can be closed, etc. In today's very fractured congress, however, it's unclear if individuals ever are actually swayed by deliberations in the floor of the legislature, or if they've already decided to follow their party lines or their specific interests, long before they entered the Capitol buildings. </p>

<p>A smaller example of a true deliberative system, based on guiding discussions as much as holding votes, is found in <a href="http://www.robertsrules.org/">Robert's Rules of Order</a>, a guide for conducting meetings. These rules detail explicit methods not just for voting, but also for the deliberation and discussion surrounding the voting. Various <em>majority</em> and <em>minority</em> votes can be taken to allow for certain actions.</p>

<p>Because deciding directly upon ideas rather than just voting for representatives can have a greater effect upon a community, the deliberative systems may need to be more complex to avoid abuse, as evidenced by the complexities of the U.S. Government and Robert's Rule of Order. However, these very complexities can make these systems more prone to purposeful gaming. The benefits and deficits of more complex deliberative systems have not yet been fully studied, nor have there been as much analysis of &quot;attacks&quot; against them.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/consensus_1.jpg"><img width="150" height="141" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/consensus_1.jpg" title="Consensus_1" alt="Consensus_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a><a name="consensus_systems"></a><strong><a name="consensus_systems">Consensus Systems:</a></strong> In consensus systems people jointly come to a consensus as a group through group interactions. This sort of decision making theoretically avoids the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; and likewise can produce more informed decision making. It's a variant of the broader <em>deliberative systems</em>, but one with more group and less individual power.</p>

<p>One example of consensual selection is cabinet government as laid out under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_system">Westminster System</a>. Wikipedia describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p><em> Members of the Cabinet are collectively seen as responsible for government policy. All Cabinet decisions are made by consensus, a vote is never taken in a Cabinet meeting. All ministers, whether senior and in the Cabinet, or junior ministers, must support the policy of the government publicly regardless of any private reservations. If a minister does not agree with a decision he, or she, can resign from the government; as did several British ministers over the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. This means that in the Westminster system of government the cabinet always collectively decides all decisions and all ministers are responsible for arguing in favour of any decision made by the cabinet.</em></p> </blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Quaker-based_consensus">Quaker-based consensus</a> offers a similar example. Herein a facilitator helps to identify disagreements and agreements to move a discussion forward until an end result is embraced by all individuals.</p>

<p>As a final note, it's important to differentiate consensus from coercion. The end result of unanimity isn't the sole definition of a consensus system, nor is it entirely required. What is required is a more open and thoughtful selection process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="opinion_systems">Opinion Systems</a></h3>

<p><img border="0" alt="Poll" title="Poll" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/poll.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />Opinion systems are a clear subsidiary category to selection systems. An opinion system's main use is as a decision indicator, to show how people will decide or did decide in a representative system, a deliberative system, or both. Current opinion systems tend to be oriented toward actual votes, as opposed to more freeform selection systems (though the <em>delphic polling system</em> shows a more freeform version of the category itself). Opinion systems tend to be push-based (meaning people are asked for their opinions rather than actively offering them), but this isn't required. </p>

<p>All opinion systems tend to have the same general problem, which is figuring out how to use scientific means to determine the actual results of a decision. This means massaging respondent numbers to offset categories of people more or less likely to vote to try and generate the actual results. For example, one 1998 poll showed that 62% of Republicans were absolutely certain they were going to vote, while only 51% of Independents could say the same. This means that every Republican voter a poll contacted in that year might have been weighted about 1.2x over every Independent contacted. Of course the actual calculations are much more complex than that, since they tend to depend upon traditional voter turnout and lots of analysis, but the core idea is sound, which is that every polled individual should <u>not</u> be considered equal.</p>

<p>All opinion system results tend to be rated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error">margins of error</a>. The margin of error is a percent spread which the poll is expected to be within, 90-99% of the time (depending on how conservative of a confidence rating is given). If a poll shows that a politician is expected to take 48% of the vote, for example, and the margin of error is 4%, that means he is expected to take 44-52% of the vote with 90-99% surety. Margins of error are typically given much greater importance in the modern media than they should, as they're calculated solely based upon the total number of respondents to a poll.</p>

<p>There are two general categories of opinion systems: <em>pre-voting (subjective) polling systems</em> and <em>post-voting (objective) polling systems</em>. A different type of opinion system, <em>delphic polling</em>, which could apply to either pre- or post-voting systems is also covered. Polling systems not directly related to selection systems are covered later, as <em>subjective rating systems</em>, since they tend to have issues very different from other polling systems, as their goal isn't to try and match the &quot;true&quot; number of an actual vote.</p>

<p><strong><a name="pre-voting_polling_systems">Pre-voting Polling Systems:</a></strong> These are polls made before a vote is cast. They're often called &quot;opinion polls&quot; and tend to be conducted via phone. They try and isolate &quot;likely voters&quot; and determine how they will vote. This question of voter likelihood is one of the first issues with a pre-voting system, because there's no guarantee that the polled people will actually later vote. Likewise, pre-voting systems have to accommodate &quot;undecided voters&quot; and the fact that no voter has ever truly made up their mind until they cast their final ballot. Unlike post-voting polling systems, pre-voting systems also have considerable more possibility for bias (which is not accounted for by margins of error), based upon how questions are asked, in what order, and with what additional text.</p>

<p><strong><img border="0" alt="Exitpoll" title="Exitpoll" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/exitpoll.png" style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;" /> <a name="post-voting_polling_systems">Post-voting Polling Systems:</a></strong> These are polls taken after a vote is cast. They're typically called &quot;exit polls&quot;, as most are conducted as people are leaving a &quot;polling&quot; station (where they cast a vote). One would expect these to be much more reliable than pre-voting polls, but as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities#Exit_polls">2004 U.S. Presidential Election</a> showed, exit polls can be wildly inaccurate.</p>

<p>One of the problems with post-voting polling systems, shared with pre-voting systems, is that the results must be manipulated to make sure that respondents to the poll match the percentages of those constituencies in the overall populations. For example, in the 2004 exit polls it appears that women were initially overrepresented in exit polls, and because of increased black turnout it appears that blacks were underrepresented in the exit polls. It can easily be seen how either of these misrepresentations could cause notable changes in an exit poll result.</p>

<p>When conducted &amp; matched correctly, exit polls are supposed to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy%2C_exit_polls#Reliability_of_Exit_Polls">quite reliable</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/delphiamphitheatre.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=458,height=317,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="138" border="0" alt="Delphiamphitheatre" title="Delphiamphitheatre" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/delphiamphitheatre.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> <a name="delphic_polling_systems">Delphic Polling Systems:</a></strong> An interesting polling method applicable to all sorts of opinion systems is the &quot;delphi poll&quot;. This is a specific method of polling which is <em>iterative</em> and <em>anonymous</em> and which supports <em>confidence ratings</em> and <em>feedback</em>. The general idea is that people are polled on a question using not just binary responses, but a full confidence rating (e.g., you would state that you are 60% sure that Bush would be elected, rather than stating that you think Bush would be elected). After polls are collected, the anonymous results--or at least a summary of those results--are shared with the participants, who then poll again. This iterative process continues until a consistent answer is settled upon. By incorporating feedback into the polling process there's the possibility for greatly increased reliability.</p>

<p>In some ways delphic polling systems can be seen as an analogy to <em>consensus systems</em>, since both involve more iterative processes that eventually result in a more commonly-held decision.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="comparison_systems">Comparison Systems</a></h3>

<p>Comparison systems allow individual items to be measured up against each other. There are three general categories: <em>comparison ranking systems</em>, which are largely objective and which typically rank people; and <em>comparison rating systems</em>, which more often mix subjective and objective opinions, and which more frequently rate things; and <em>reputation rating systems</em>, which again tend to rank people, but also have a subject and objective mix. </p>

<p><strong><a name="ranking_systems">Comparison Ranking Systems:</a></strong> In a ranking system, items in a hierarchy (most frequently people) rise or fall based upon specific, objective, and well-known rules. This is the heart of most multiplayer competitive systems.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=500,height=336,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/chess.jpg"><img width="200" height="134" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/chess.jpg" title="Chess" alt="Chess" style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: left;" /></a> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system">ELO System</a> is an example of a ranking system used for two-player games, and is used by the U.S. Chess Federation. Days of Wonder uses a <a href="http://www.gangoffour.com/index.php?t=content&amp;sub=ranking">multiplayer variant of the ELO system</a> for their online games. Each system builds a simple distribution of player ratings around a norm (typically 1500 points), then awards or deducts points based upon wins and losses, with the total sum of all points in the system staying constant. Players are then ranked according to their comparative scores. </p>

<p>There are flaws in ranking systems like ELO. For example, two players could collude, with one purposefully throwing games so that his opponent could increase his ranking. Alternatively if a player gets a few lucky victories against good opponents, his rating might temporarily skyrocket above its normative value. However, these tend to be well-known and well-researched problems.</p>

<p>These are numerous other ranking systems which are used for competitions, from double-elimination seeded tournaments (e.g., a tennis tournament) to ranked comparisons based upon win-loss ratios (e.g., baseball standings). Objective rankings are also (less commonly) used to rank items, such as a ranking of cars based upon safety ratings.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/usmc_enlisted_rank_structure.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=476,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="200" height="148" border="0" alt="Usmc_enlisted_rank_structure" title="Usmc_enlisted_rank_structure" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/usmc_enlisted_rank_structure.jpg" style="margin: 5px 5px 0px 0px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>Most ranking systems create a hierarchy of positive rankings (e.g., &quot;best chess players ever&quot;). However, a hierarchy of negative rankings may also most be used, most commonly based on a negative criteria (e.g., &quot;biggest Player Killers (PKers)&quot;). In addition, either direction of ranking can use threshold systems to mark positive or negative rankings that meet a certain criteria. A positive threshold might be a &quot;Grand Master&quot; ranking threshold for anyone with a Chess rating of 2700, while a negative threshold might be a &quot;Player Killer&quot; ranking threshold, for with sufficient &quot;accidental&quot; PKs.</p>

<p>Ranking systems are somewhat removed from the other collective choice systems listed here, since there's isn't a collaborative decision, only a collective result. However their problems &amp; results remain closely related to the more collective rating and reputation systems, hence their inclusion. </p>

<p><strong><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=373,height=239,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/stars_1.gif"><img width="200" height="128" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/stars_1.gif" title="Stars_1" alt="Stars_1" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> <a name="rating_systems">Rating Systems:</a></strong> In a rating system, the value of individual items (most frequently goods) rise or fall based upon the largely subjective judgment of individual users.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> are two examples of stores which provide subjective rating systems. Individual users rate items from 1 to 5 stars, then an average user rating is calculated. <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com">BoardGameGeek</a> offers a slightly different example because it not only lets users rate individual items, but also ranks items against each other based upon those ratings.</p>

<p>Flaws in these systems are similar to those in ranking systems: low numbers of ratings producing bad rankings, and individual users purposefully biasing ratings. Some mathematical methods may be used to smooth out these issues, among them <em>bayesian averages</em>, which give ratings weight based upon total number of ratings for an item.</p>

<p>The Stock Market offers an example of a different sort of rating system, because there's theoretically some objective basis to it. In a perfect Stock Market system, stock prices are based upon a solid cost analysis, such as a multiplier on yearly revenues or profits. However, as the Internet bubble of the late 1990s conclusively showed, there's also a high irrational component to stock purchases: thus subjective and objective views are combined in the rating (cost) of a stock.</p>

<p><strong><a name="reputation_systems">Reputation Systems:</a></strong> Finally, reputation systems are very similar to ranking systems: items in a hierarchy (most frequently people) rise or fall based upon specific and well-known rules. However, unlike true ranking systems, reputation systems instead base their rules for rise and fall upon other user feedback. </p>

<p>The goal of a reputation system is ultimately to create a trust metric that often allows different users access to different powers. We'll be covering reputation systems a bit more thoroughly in a couple of weeks. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There are a variety of ways to measure the collective choices of a large group of people. We've outline nine here: representative, deliberative, and consensus selection systems; ranking, rating, and reputation comparison systems; and three varieties of opinion systems. When developing social software it is important to understand the difference between these broad categories of systems and to use lessons already learned from the appropriate category in your own social software designs.</p>

EXCERPT:
Collective choice systems have been around for a long time. Since at least the birth of democracy in ancient Greece people have made joint decisions about important issues, and since at least the knightly tournaments of the late Middle Age people have competed to be ranked against their peers. Today Western culture especially values diversity of input when implementing any type of choice, believing that wide input from a variety of people provides the fairest result. [post continues with discussion of different types of collective choice systems]

My intent was more to outline the broad categories of collective choice, then to give all the possible examples within each category. Both consensus methods and facilitated decision making processes fall under the "deliberation systems" category.

It is my hope in future articles to dig deeper into each broad category and show more examples of types. Next week hopefully will be comparison rating systems.

You should take a look at Jeff Vails' writings on rhizome networks as counter weights to hierchical power structures. http://www.jeffvail.net/2005/08/rhizome-communication-and-our-one-time.html 

There's a connection between your ideas and his that I can't quite articulate because my mind is focussed elsewhere at the moment. But I shall return.

I've made some changes to this blog entry, adding consensus systems under deliberation systems, added reputation systems as a type of opinion system, simplifying some of the category names, and added some links.

This is an excellent summary, but I feel like I want a comparison table of some kind.

Would "information futures market" or the like be a Delphic system? It sure seems more like a consensus measuring device to me.

One of the most interesting things about all of these systems is the side effects they have on the decisions made. Binary Votes polorize options. Information Futures Markets encourage results manipulation (by design!)

This is a wonderful overview.  Thank you for putting it together!

I'd like to suggest one small correction to the description of Condorcet voting, which says "it is much harder on the voters, who have to rank every single candidate".  In a Condorcet system, the voters don't have to rank every candidate; they can rank as many or as few as they want (just like IRV), and they can even rank candidates equally (unlike IRV).  The Wikipedia article entitled "Condorcet method" describes this.

Regarding a comparison of these systems, i've tried to illustrate the behaviour of plurality, approval, IRV, and Condorcet elections at http://zesty.ca/voting/ , and i hope you will find my method and results interesting.

The problem of choice is outline very well in the book 'The Paradox of Choice' by Bary Schwartz.  It provides a great description of some of the other challenges of multi-party elections. I found it very interesting when it got into the psychology of choice regret, and alternative choices.

I agree this is a very interesting article!  I notice an (intentional?) lack of coverage of most of the dominant and mature decision-making institutions in our society: markets in general (and specifically institutions such as exchanges -- mentioned briefly -- auctions, fixed-price retail stores vs. haggling bazaars, and so on), risk sharing institutions (e.g. insurance), hierarchical organizations based on the employer-employee and boss-subordinate relationships, the judiciary based on written law, opinion, and precedent, and so on.  Of course, it would be very ambitious to tackle these, but it would at least be interesting to try to categorize them according to your taxonomy.  Perhaps they are so complex they often fall into multiple categories.

The systems you describe abstract a vast amount of diffuse and often tacit information pertinent to a decision into a numerical result. Most economists (particularly Austrian school) would argue that at least on a large scale prices generated by auctions and exchanges generally do this better than other collective decision making systems.  On the other hand, many systems for collective choice don't work via an abstract numerical intermediary (e.g. the opinion and precedent system of the judiciary). 

I suggest that the most important factor in these institutions is the costs involved in eliciting diffuse knowledge and lossily compressing it into a decision which is hopefully nevertheless a reasonably accurate reflection of that diffuse information.

At least part of the reason why I didn't strongly highlight markets is that the definition of "collective choice", at least as far as how many academics use it, is all the methods that groups make decisions EXCEPT markets. For instance, from http://www.bsos.umd.edu/umccc/ "models of individual rational choice behavior to study non-market social phenomena".

However, another definition is http://www.artsci.wustl.edu/~polisci/calvert/PolSci505/ "social choice theory and noncooperative game theory", and I might say that markets fall into a subset of noncooperative game theory.

Personally I'm not sure why most academics exclude markets, thus I do briefly mention the Stock Market as a subcategory of comparison system. I hope to mention them more in other future articles, in particular, prediction markets as a subcategory of Polling Systems.

Will you cover, in a future post the forced choice vote? I'd welcome learning about more ways that a group can discuss alternatives (online or in person) then either vote in a priority way (first choice, second choice, etc.) 
and/ or choose to vote in a first round for "x" number of options then limit the conversation to those options, then perhaps do a forced choice vote.

In other words what are some hybrid methods that you 
(amazing) Christopher might craft that combine:

A. Thoughtful conversation to hear all ideas/opinions - 
without the downsides of :
• being prolonged to the point it pains participants
               and/or
• being dominated by one or two "strong" or verbose personalities

 .....with 

B. Stages of voting closure that enable all participants 
to see 'we' are moving to the top choice(s) of the group

 - another fan of life with alacrity

p.s. In addition to the aforementioned, brilliant, The Paradox of Choice, read Smart Choices by Howard Raiffa

BODY:
<p>There is some more excellent research this week by <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/">Nick Yee</a> and <a href="http://www.parc.com/nicolas">Nicolas Ducheneaut</a> in the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/">PlayOn</a> blog. Again, their research provides good insight into social group dynamics as they appear in online games.</p>
<p>I last mentioned their research on guild sizes in my blog post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html">Dunbar &amp; World of Warcraft</a> where I compare the distribution of guild sizes in <a href="http://www.uo.com/">Ultima Online</a> vs PlayOn&#39;s results from <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a>. However, both distribution tables suffer from a variety of biases due to the nature of the different game designs, many of which are discussed in the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/08/dunbar_world_of.html#comments">commments in the post</a>. For instance both guild graphs include &quot;alts&quot;, which are alternative characters of individual players. Thus one player might be represented multiple times in a guild.</p>
<p>In Nic &amp; Nick&#39;s more recent research, they are looking deeper and are <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html">mapping social networks</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090425222428/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/mapping_social.html">Internet Archive</a>)</em> on World of Warcraft. Using tools available to them, over the course of the month of August they looked at 241,378 characters and 5569 guilds. From that data they were able to able to discover how often guild members were co-present (online at the same time) or co-located (online and in the same zone in the game)</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="G-3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c611970c-500wi" title="G-3" /></a></p>
<p>For example, in this map you can see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>...we have a guild where we see more distinct cliques. There&#39;s a somewhat hard-core 4 character cluster on the left- hand side, a mid-level triad on the bottom left, a mid 20&#39;s clique that&#39;s held together by the druid in the middle, and finally a more casual low-level clique on the top right.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using this same data, they then looked at the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">max subgraph size of guilds</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use&#0160;<a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">Internet Archive</a>)</em>. A &quot;subgraph&quot; in a social network can be thought of as a &quot;clique&quot; of people that interact with each other.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image005" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b7c82940ec970b-500wi" title="Image005" /></a></p>
<p>For instance, in the social network of this guild there are 5 subgraphs, 4 of which are just 2 people and 1 subgraph that is of 6. The 4 subgraphs that are only of 2 people are members of the guild who did not participate much in the guild. But the number of people in the subgraph of 6 is much more interesting, as it shows that these members are &quot;cohesive&quot;.</p>
<p>When the max subgraph size of a guild is plotted against the guild size, you get some interesting results -- the maximum guild cohesiveness occurs around the guild size of 50. Larger then that, guilds have a much more difficult time remaining cohesive.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image011" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c66b970c-500wi" title="Image011" /></a></p>
<p>These results strong support my hypothesis in my original <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> post, where I...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &quot;grooming&quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&#39;t have requisite variety.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some possible other support for this hypothesis comes from another post by Nic &amp; Nick where they analyze the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html">time guilds spend together</a>&#0160;(now 404, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081119142033/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guild_members_t.html">Internet Archive</a>).</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image004" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01b8d1b3c680970c-500wi" title="Image004" /></a></p>
<p>Note that the mean amount of time that guilds spend together in the band 31 - 60 is only 95 minutes and that the standard deviation is the lowest, as compared to groups that are larger then 120 where the mean time is 141 minutes at the standard deviation is higher. This says to me that keeping a large group cohesive requires significantly more time in social &quot;grooming&quot;.</p>
<p>In my original <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> post I had a secondary hypothesis where I talk about peak in satisfaction in smaller groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of &quot;team&quot; really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough &quot;attention&quot; is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is strong support for this in another plot found in the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">max subgraph size of guilds</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081231143011/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/10/guilds_max_subg.html">Internet Archive</a>)</em> post where they compare the subgraph ration to guild sizes:</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Image013" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d img-responsive" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341d8bc053ef01bb08cde1c9970d-500wi" title="Image013" /></a></p>
<p>Here you can see a strong peak at 10 people, that rapidly falls with guild size. This shows that guild cohesion is relatively easy to maintain up to size 10, but becomes much more difficult to maintain as guilds grow larger.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been saying for some time that studying online games is a valuable place to understanding social software. I&#39;m quite pleased that this research is proving this to be true.</p>

Chris, intersting data.

I am not sure that with standard deviations so high on the "Time spent together by guild size" that you can draw super strong conclusions about differences been group cohesiveness by group.  One or two extra-connected group is going to throw off your numbers quite a bit.  If you have the data and can scatterplot them instead of showing averages I suspect you'll be able to make a case more clear.

The military, and educational institutions, have discovered similar thresholds for collectivities. I think the number of friends any of us can sustain, in any manner (on, offline) is around 200. And that's pushing it. Magic numbers in small business are 12 and approx 30-35, I believe. Intersting that it might hold for online as well as offline.

Great series on Dunbar limit. One minor nitpick - I think your first PlayOn image link might be wrong. I thing the text you've quoted refers to their bottom-left image which is g-3 rather than g-4 (the 4-character cluster is *really* obvious in g-3).

BODY:
<p>For the last several months I've been working on a new open source project that I've been calling <a href="http://www.synchroedit.com">SynchroEdit</a>. SynchroEdit is a browser-based simultaneous multiuser editor, useful for <a href="http://www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/rng/teaching/notes/CSCWgroupware.html">&quot;same-time&quot; collaboration</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/synchroeditmac.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=493,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="262" height="202" border="0" alt="Synchroeditmac" title="Synchroeditmac" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/synchroeditmac.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The basic concept is that it allows multiple users to WYSIWYG edit a single web-based document, all at exactly the same time. SynchroEdit continuously synchronizes all changes so that users always see the same version. They can also see each others' changes as they type, see where each user is currently editing, and see each others' changes by color.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is a tool for &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration, either &quot;same-time, different-place&quot;, as in teleconference calls, or &quot;same-time, same-place&quot;, during a meeting or a conference. If you've ever used <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> on Mac OS X, or <a href="http://www.moonedit.com">MoonEdit</a> for Windows or Linux, or the cross-platform <a href="http://gobby.0x539.de/">Gobby</a>, this is a similar experience. The difference is that unlike those tools you are not limited to just plain text -- character styles (bold, italic, etc.) and paragraph styles (rulers, headers, blockquotes, etc) are synchronized as well. And of course, it all works inside your browser.</p>

<p>SynchroEdit is inspired by my frustration with the lack of an easily accessible cross-platform simultaneous editor. Many times when I've been on the phone with a colleague discussing a draft blog entry, or demonstrating some code, or on a teleconference call with others to discuss a proposal or a standard, or at a conference taking notes with others, I've wanted to have this tool. The rare occasions that we all have been on the same platform and have been able to use an existing tool have demonstrated to me the value of having a good simultaneous editor. Having SynchroEdit available will make it easier for people to have these positive collaborative experiences.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have a long history with &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration tools -- back in 1988 I was briefly executive producer at Broderbund for a same-time groupware product called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1cDDTqwlqGoJ:www.the-scientist.com/yr1988/jul/software_p22_880725.html+%2Bbroderbund+%2B%22for+comment%22+groupware">For Comment</a>. Unfortunately, the success of the Nintendo game console forced Broderbund to drop all of their non-consumer product efforts. In the early 90's I worked on several different &quot;same-time same-place&quot; groupware tools for live meetings. Most recently, my game company <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos Tech</a>, created several browser-based &quot;enhanced chat&quot; clients for playing in MUSH-like storytelling games, which are also &quot;same-time&quot;.</p>



<p>I personally believe that that this capability should be a fundamental feature of the web, sort of the obvious extension of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee's</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4132752.stm">vision</a> of the editable web. Thus my desire to offer this tool as open source, allowing anyone to add this capability to their own software (unlike proprietary editor services such as <a href="http://www.jotlive.com">JotLive</a> or <a href="http://www.writely.com/">Writely</a>).</p>



<p>The challenge with offering SynchroEdit as open source is finding a business model -- unlike an application like <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a> or a service like <a href="http://www.jotlive.com">JotLive</a>, it is difficult to get revenues from individual users. Instead, we ask for contributions from companies that might find the tool useful, we offer consulting to customize it for specific purposes, and we give these companies public credit for their contributions to the common good.</p>

<p>The first company to step up to the plate is <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a>, an enterprise wiki company. Clearly, being able to offer this capability to their customers will give them added value, and they already have a history of using open source with their support of <a href="http://www.kwiki.org/">Kwiki</a> and <a href="http://www.wikiwyg.net/">Wikiwyg</a>.</p>

<p>The second supporter is venture capitalist and blogger <a href="http://joi.ito.com/">Joichi Ito</a>. He is is particularly well known for his own experiments with &quot;same-time&quot; collaboration. He runs a continuous #joiito IRC chat room, active 24 hours a day with hundreds of his friends. He also has done many live &quot;same-time&quot; experiments with chat backchannel during his talks at various conferences.</p>

<p>In addition to to financial support of SocialText and Joichi Ito, I have some offers of help from the <a href="http://www.bgiedu.org">Bainbridge Graduate Institute</a>, who plan to use it in its socially responsible and environmentally sustainable MBA program, and we've also taken advantage of some code developed by <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a>.</p>

<p>The development of SynchroEdit is being led by Kalle Alm, a young Swedish coder I met when he was creating an online game at Skotos. Skotos has long had the vision of having games created by its members, and Kalle Alm was the first member to create a game completely from scratch using Skotos' tools.</p>

<p>We are seeking more financial contributions so that we can accelerate development. Currently SynchroEdit only works in Mozilla/Firefox, and I anticipate that making it work with Internet Explorer may be quite difficult, so we'll need more partners to help.</p>

I'm curious about what ways you think this could be useful as a teaching aid? Have you looked into particular implementations or studied existing case studies?
(I have studied this a fair amount and I don't think there are existing case studies, especially in the classroom, which is why I ask.. I'm looking at ways in which chatrooms could be incorporated into classroom environments as a backchannel)

<p>In my initial blog entry on the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> I presented some statistics on group sizes based on the online game <a href="http://www.uo.com">Ultimata Online</a>. In it you could clearly see the power-law (pareto) curve, with diminishing returns at around 150, with most groups being 60 in size:</p>

<p>More recently, <a href="http://www.nickyee.com/">Nick Yee</a> and other researchers at the <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/">PlayOn Blog</a> have been researching the behaviors of players in the popular <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">World of Warcraft</a> online game. At my request, they sampled guild sizes over a one-week period, and prepared <a href="http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html">similar graphs</a>&#0160;<em>(now 404, use&#0160;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060205115408/http://blogs.parc.com/playon/archives/2005/07/guild_size.html">internet archive link</a>)</em>:</p>

<p>Overall, these statistics still support my original hypothesis in my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> post that mean group sizes will be smaller than 150 for non-survival oriented groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &quot;grooming&quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don&#39;t have requisite variety.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the diminishing returns for large groups in <em>World of Warcraft</em> appear to cut off much sooner then they do in <em>Ultima Online</em>, with the 95th percentile 54 and the 99th percentile being 110. When I asked about why the &#39;knee&#39; was much closer to 50 rather than <em>Ultima Online&#39;s </em>knee around 150, <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/">Raph Koster</a> (the game designer who gave me the original <em>Ultima Online</em> data) answered that it might be because <em>Ultima Online</em> used a &quot;veteran member&quot; method of counting. This could result in under reporting of new users and thus pushing up sizes of more established groups.</p>
<p>Also different was the fact that the <em>World of Warcraft</em> guild sizes display a reverse power-law, with the smallest groups being much more common, rather then the bell curve of <em>Ultima Online</em>. If one-person guilds are excluded, the average guild size was 16.8, the median was 9. This seems to correspond much closer to my thoughts on a smaller &#39;nodal&#39; threshold for group size that I&#39;ve observed at around 15, which I describe in <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/03/dunbar_altruist.html">Dunbar, Altruistic Punishment, and Meta-Moderation</a>.</p>
<p>My guess is that there is something about <em>Worlds of Warcraft</em> such that even participating in very small groups can be useful, whereas for <em>Ultima Online</em> the utility is gained mainly by sharing the resources earned by larger groups. Thus <em>Worlds of Warcraft</em> has groups that are &quot;bands&quot; as well as &quot;tribes&quot;, while with <em>Ultima Online</em> groups are more llikely to be just &quot;tribes&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not had time to play <em>Worlds of Warcraft</em> yet, so I&#39;m curious if those who have more experience would agree with my hypothesis.</p>

I play WoW on a regular basis, and I have to admit that I was a bit surprised by the preponderance of small guilds, as the best high-end gear is available in instances that require raids involving large groups of high-level players (up to 40 people). In fact, this is an oft repeated complaint on the WoW forums: smaller guilds do not have access to this gear unless they can manage to form alliances with other small guilds. 

However, for low and mid-level players, going through instances only requires 5-player groups, and instances are usually the best source for great gear at every level, so for those players who haven't reached level 60 yet, there is no immediate advantage to joining a large guild. 

I would therefore be curious to see a correlation between player level and guild size.

I play WoW and I've never played UO but I've heard from many MMORPG veterans that WoW is far too kind in terms of its penalities for death. In fact, there's little penalty for death besides 10% damage to your equipment (easily repairable) and walking your spirit back your corpse. In other games, things like gold, items, rank and experience can be lost as a result of character death.

This could mean that there's simply less of a survival mentality amoungst players and groups are formed for rewards rather than for aversion of penalties.

I don't know about UO, but WoW features individualised gear. Certain gear, once "owned," simply cannot be passed on to someone else. As such, in the earlier levels, it's possible that players not even bother to join a guild. It's entirely viable to solo up until the high level instances. There isn't as much dependence on grouping.

My opinion, of course. YMMV.

Some sent me an email, asking to be quoted anonymously:

Some facts about WoW guild sizes:

What is the point of a guild with one member? Since the guild name is displayed with your character, then it is like a last name for your character ( a further way to show how clever you are) even a guild of one can have it's own guild tabard

Guild of less then 5: You can only have 2 professions so it is worthwhile to team up with others that you can trade goods with tailoring/enchanting mining/blacksmithing skinning/leather-working there is also mining/engineering but almost none of the stuff engineers make can be shared so for lower level character a group of 3 can be VERY helpful, also 3 is an easy to maintain group size and obviously the killing/questing goes much faster. This group falls apart for characters higher then 30 (for reason listed below)

Guilds of around 5+: Most instance dungeons must be done with 5 players, each with a role (tank, healer, damage, off-tank, off-healer), a 3 player guild will need 2 pick-up players.  Pick-up players, as a rule, are used to playing solo and don't stay in a role as well, leading to lots of problems.

Guilds of around 40+: High lvl dungeons need 40 players, so I think your results would look extremely different if you only showed lvl 50 or higher characters also blacksmithing splits into 2 specialties and leather-working splits into 3 specialties leading to larger group size.

Another thing that affects group size is "alts", if I create a killer guild, I am going to want all my characters to belong to it, even if I don't play them anymore.  So by looking a just lvl50 or higher characters I think you would strip out a lot of "alts", and that would give a better "real" group size

WoW has taken a lot of steps to enable players to find players to group with, such as dedicated chat channels and a system allowing players to join a queue and be automatically placed in groups.  Also WoW is incredibly solo-friendly - you never need to group to get to level 60, and even some endgame content is accessible such as the PvP Battlegrounds.  The points already mentioned about the simple tradeskill structure and absence of tradeable 'hand-me-downs' are crucial as well, so I'm not too surprised you see a smaller average guild size.

If WoW incorporated a working formal alliance structure you might see it splinter even more.

On a more general note, if a guild is being formed for 40-person raids, only the hardest of the hardcore will actually have 40 players - they'd want sufficient numbers to be able to routinely get 40 players of appropriate level and class distribution together.  

My WoW guild has reached sizes where 40-person groups are sometimes possible spontaneously.  In my opinion we're skirting, and probably have crossed into, the 'too-large' realm.  I find I'm more likely to ignore guild chat, simply because there are so many people and things going on.  I also don't feel as close to guildmates - to the point of not recognizing some - which has never happened to me before.

I blame the game.  WoW owes much of it's success to being more casual friendly, and has a tendency to attract and even promote less social playstyles.  I notice my behavior is changed from past MMO's when I was perfectly happy to just chat for awhile.  In WoW everything is go, less (or no) downtime between fights, more interaction needed during battles (I most often play a rogue, which plays more like a FPS than anything else), less travel time, it all adds up to a game which is very fun, yes, but definatley less social.

P.S.  Anyone studied the effects of Teamspeak on optimal group/raid/guild sizes?

World of Warcraft is actually quite intricate in its workings. The style of play often changes with the level of the player's character(s). Also, the ruleset a person is playing on influences how they group and interact with people.

For instance, on the PvP servers, now that the majority of players have had high level characters for a while, practically no one does low-level instances. People are either busy in battlegrounds (BG's) or high level instances. So most people who aren't level 60 end up soloing or grouping with very few people. But a guild is ideal to have, as you can call people in for backup when enemy players are ganking you while levelling up. But this makes the size of these guilds rather arbitrary.

When a person reaches level 60 on the PvP servers, they tend to join a guild that participates in PvP fairly often. It doesn't require many people to PvP, as some BG's only allow 10 people. And those BG's that allow more are difficult to get into, so people only enter in small groups anyway. Even for the small BG's it can be difficult to enter the server with a predetermined group, due to the way the queueing system works. So the desire for small groups on PvP servers is high (as it is easier to enter the BG's). This can make some guilds fairly small.

It should be noted about the PvE ruleset that a lot of low-level players are able to participate in low-end 5-to-10-man dungeons (almost always done with 5), as the interest in fairly high amongst those levelling up alts and new players. So people new to this low-level content often join small guilds, or guilds with a vast number of low-level alts.

Now, when people participate in high-level dungeons, things are a little different. Really, there is only one high-level dungeon that is for five people. And there are a few high-level dungeons that allow for 10 or 15 people, but neither they nor the 5-man dungeon offer the best loot. This causes only casual players to really concentrate on that content.

Sometimes, a player will want to approach the game in a serious, hardcore manner, but because they can't handle large groups or are generally anti-social, they may end up staying in a smaller guild. I've encountered three cases of this, all of which involved personal online gaming friends.

In terms of hardcore, high-level content, you have three 40-man dungeons (however, I'd classify one of them as a simple encounter), one 20-man dungeon and two outdoor, 40-man encounters that offer the best loot. With the addition of the 20-man raid dungeon, I expect average guild sizes will fall slightly. But I'm sure there will be plenty of guilds concentrating on the 40-man PvE content.

In order to do the complex 40-man raid dungeons, you need a guild that has at least 40 people that can play regularly, the right class setup, and backups to take the place of crucial missing pieces. However, I have often found that there are "regulars" that show up to almost every raid. This means the number of backups is usually relatively small.

This explanation is not very eloquent, I realize, but I hope it brings some insight into things. It's rather a subjective opinion, as well. I don't have numbers to back this up--it's all based on personal experience with both rulesets.

I saw your open question as to whether World of Warcraft had some characteristics that caused it to trend towards lower guild sizes.
 
I've been playing World of Warcraft since release. In short, your answer is "yes".
 
Compared to other MMOs, World of Warcraft is different in significant respects. The level grind to cap (60) is -much- less intense than in comparable games. I believe that the average time to 60 in terms of days played is about 15 days and it can be much less for a veteran player.
 
WoW is very quest-oriented and a majority of quests are accomplishable solo. Quests usually fall into the typical categories of kill-quests, loot-quests, and Fedexes. If you want to level quickly, you do this by solo grinding and cherry-picking quests.
 
On the path to 60, WoW offers several instanced raid dungeons. On the alliance side, there's Deadmines, Stockades, Shadowfang Keep, Uldaman, Scarlet Monastery, Zul'Farrak, Maraudon, Sunken Temple. These instances have some quests in them, but, in addition, they're participant-capped. No more than 5 grouped players can be in the instance parts of these dungeons.
 
This has the effect of allowing guilds with less than 5 regular people to successfully reach level cap as a social group.
 
Once a player reaches 60, however, things start to change. 60th level players very quickly exhaust the number of quests that are available to them. This leaves only the high-end instances to do:
 
Blackrock Depths
Stratholme
Scholomance
Blackrock Spire
Zul'Gurub
Molten Core
 
The maximum number of players who can participate on these endgame instances increases dramatically. Blackrock Depths is limited to 5 participants. Strat and Scholo are 10, I think. Blackrock Spire is 15. Molten Core is 40. Zul'Gurub is a new "starter" raid instance that requires 20.
 
Small guilds who make it to 60 often find that they are 'stranded', without enough critical mass to perform the higher level raid instances but without the connections to join with other guilds to participate in them. This abrupt transition of the gameplay at the end from casual to hardcore is a common player complaint.
 
Another factor that may lead to smaller guild sizes in the endgame compared to Ultima Online is that practically all raid content IS instanced. This means that to get the best loot, a guild needs to be able to muster only the raid-limit cap for that particular instance. In contrast, in Ultima Online, my understanding is that many of the end-game bosses are out 'in the open' and on long spawns. This means that to achieve success, guilds in that game not only need to be able to muster enough players to defeat the raid encounter but must ALSO achieve enough mass in order to prevent other guilds from dominating the spawn. This becomes a sheer numbers game.

While I have not played WOW, in EVE-online another MMPOG, the occurence of corporations smaller than 3 is usually because the members are subverting the rules.

samll corps exist so that people can play solo, outside of the normal social infrastructure. In dangerous areas the new player corps are normally Kill On Site, so experienced solo players create a corp for the small number of characters that individual person operates.

small corps exist so that you can declare war and blackmail other corps without your main corp suffering any fallback.

Or they serve as peoples murderous 'alt' characters, again so that you can avoid any come back onto your main character or corp.

small corps exist so that they can create clones without needing to build high standing of your main corp (a sort of game exploit).

small corps exist to scam money out of people by creating fake lotteries etc

small corps exist so that an alt character can run a business away from the normal agreed rules of the corp that the main character is part of.

If similar things happen in other MMPOGs, it might be worth ignoring the small groups when drawing conclusions about social groups, they usually exist to either be explicitly anti-social or to subvert the game mechanics in some way.

BODY:
<p>In yesterday's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=2">All Things Considered</a>, NPR commentator <a href="http://jakehalpern.com/news.html">Jake Halpern</a> questions why you feel like you have a relationship with the characters in your favorite TV shows. His answer: &quot;That's because you do.&quot; This idea is interesting not just to help us understand how we relate to imaginary characters, but also to correlate with our own understanding of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> relationship limits and how they might relate to this concept.</p>

<p>In his <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4772145">commentary</a>, Bostonian Jake Halpern considers two academic ideas, &quot;belongingness theory&quot; and &quot;para-social relationships&quot;, and how they affect the relationships we develop with television characters. He puts it all in the context of the 1990s TV show <em>Cheers</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/cheers.jpg" title="Cheers" alt="Cheers" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />&quot;My preoccupation with </em>Cheers the Bar<em> puzzled me until I stumbled upon a rather obscure but quite fascinating academic notion called </em>belongingness theory<em>.The argument goes something like this: in ancient times humans who stuck together increased the chances that they would survive and reproduce. So, when it came time to, say, hunt a large animal, or defend the cave against marauders, groups fared better then the guy on his own. In addition, adults in the group would have been more likely to find mates, reproduce, and raise their children. </em></p>

<p><em>The likely result of all this evolutionary selection is the creation of an internal mechanism that makes human beings crave social acceptance. The way I figured it, my irrational fondness for </em>Cheers the Bar<em> was just my belongingness mechanism kicking. I just wanted to be part of the gang.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Belongingness theory seems to have a good scientific basis. In <a href="http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeist.dp.html">Baumeister</a> &amp; Leary's 1995 paper on Belongingness Theory, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;a mp;list_uids=7777651&amp;dopt=Abstract">The Need to Belong</a>, they stated that in order for belongingness to be considered a fundamental human motivation (as opposed to a want), it would have to be universal, affect a broad range of behaviors, lead to ill effects when thwarted, and elicit goal-oriented behavior designed to satisfy it. They found evidence for all of these. </p>

<p>Personally, I'm quite comfortable with the idea that evolution has encouraged us to have a number of &quot;social emotions&quot;, and that these may include a strong desire to belong.</p>

<p>Halpern continues in his commentary with a discussion of <em>para-social relationships</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;And this brings to yet another academic theory, that of </em>para-social relationships<em>. According to academics Horton and Wohl, who originated this concept, television gives viewers the &quot;illusion of a face-to-face relationship with the performer&quot;. Gradually over the course of many episodes, viewers come to feel that they '</em>know<em>' a persona.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>I totally buy it. After watching dozens of Cheers episodes, I felt as if I knew the personas in the show intimately. In fact there were times when I had seen more of the characters on Cheers then I seen of the people in my own family. So, yeah, I definitely had some para-social relationships going on.</em></p>

<p><em>The truth is, we all yearn for companionship. The only problem is, that for many of us, myself included, the notion of a well-functioning family and a welcoming group of friends and co-workers, is occasionally more easily found on television or in the movies, than in life itself.</em></p>

<p><em>After all, in order to maintain </em>'real'<em> relationships, you have to put in a tremendous amount of effort: making phone calls; returning emails; planning weekends together; etc. To maintain para-social relationships, however, all you have to do is flick on the TV.</em></p>

<p><em>If I'm being honest with myself, I have to admit that at times, Norm, Cliff, Carla, and Sam have formed, well, a kind of para-family to which I yearn to belong. I suppose that hideously hackneyed as it sounds, it's just like the show's theme song goes: </em>&quot;Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and they're always glad you came.&quot;<em> Only, they <strong>don't</strong> know your name, and they really don't know you came.&quot;</em></p> </blockquote>

<p>Jake's description of Horton &amp; Wohl's theory on <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Modules/TF33120/horton_and_wohl_1956.html">para-social relationships</a> definitely parallels my thoughts in a previous post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2005/02/dunbar_triage_t.html">Dunbar Triage: Too Many Connections</a> where I ask <em>&quot;How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?&quot;</em> As Jake said, it's difficult because you have to make the effort: the phone calls, the emails, meeting in person, and all the rest.</p> 

<p>However, the concept of having real relationships with television characters might give us enlightenment into some other relationship issues. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the mismatch between my number of connections and my own limits due to the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>; intuitively I feel that limiting my television watching can help. This is because these TV relationships are what I call &quot;junk relationships&quot;. Sometimes when I talk about the concept of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>, I said that we may have difficulty even reaching the Dunbar limit of 150 people because of the &quot;junk relationships&quot; we maintain.</p>

<p>Does every ongoing para-social relationship with an ongoing series character, such as Cliff on Cheers or Kate on Lost, lower the number of relationships we can have with real people? I believe that this may be so.</p>

<p>And, if so, the answer to maintaining more connections with real people may be simply to turn off the television and tune in the real world instead.</p>

<blockquote><dl><dt><em><strong>Extrapolate</strong></em></dt><dd><em>To infer an unknown from something that is known; conjecture.</em><span style="font-size: 0.6em;"><br />-- The Random House College Dictionary</span></dd></dl></blockquote>

<p><a href="mailto:mlasalle@sfchronicle.com">Mick LaSalle</a>, an acerbic movie reviewer for the San Francisco Chronicle, writes a regular column &quot;Ask Mick LaSalle&quot; in the Sunday paper, where he sometimes allows others to vent their displeasure at his movie reviews. In this week's <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/07/17/PKGJNCETV81.DTL">column</a> he says something that I find very accurate to my experience with the online medium:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As for why people get hostile when they hear a differing opinion, I go back to Spinoza's definition of love and hatred. He says that people love that which they think reinforces their survival and hate that which they think threatens their survival. I believe -- this is just my humble theory, now -- that when people hear an opinion that counters theirs, their minds extrapolate from that one opinion to imagine a whole philosophical system. And then they imagine how they would fare in a world run according to that imagined system. So they go from disagreeing to feeling threatened in a matter of seconds, and they lash out. Often they write letters that begin, &quot;You are obviously,&quot; and that's where they identify, not you, but the phantom they feel threatened by.</em></p>

<p><em>Over the years, I've been &quot;obviously&quot; liberal, conservative, gay, straight, humorless, frivolous, angry and deeply jealous of Tom Hanks. When I was 30, I remember getting accused of being a 45-year-old former hippie who drove a BMW, wore a Rolex and had done acid in the '60s. I'm not sure if I wrote back, but if I did, I would have said, &quot;Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.&quot; But, of course, that kind of letter is your key to acquiring distance. It lets you know that the person's real quarrel is with some middle-aged former hippie -- probably known as Dad -- and that you're just the vehicle for that day's projection.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I think that Mick LaSalle is exactly right -- I've seen this type of hostility based on extrapolation regularly in online mediums: in emails, newsgroups, wikis, blogs, etc. I've been guilty of it a few times myself, though usually for me the result is that I don't respond at all -- &quot;Oh, he is just a flaming liberal&quot;, &quot;She's an arch-conservative&quot; or &quot;He is a just a technophobe.&quot; I can then feel comfortable in ignoring the rest of his or her point of view rather then trying to understand it.</p>

<p>I doubt if explaining this theory to someone who writes a hostile message is useful -- they will take it as yet another attack, which will likely contribute to another cycle of flamage. But I do find Mick's theory useful as another way to read and understand hostile messages, and respond more appropriately.</p>

<p>Understanding this lets me add another widget to my social software toolbox: when a group process results in a hostile message, try to determine if the author is actually reacting to what you said or if their hostility is based on extrapolating to &quot;obvious&quot; generalities. This may not allow you to directly address the hostility, but it may help you better understand it and thus not contribute to the cycle of flames.</p>

This is another limitation of our subjectivity. 

I find that too much self-consciousness, self-thought reinforces a distorted, subjective view of reality. The solution is true involvement with the external world, through attempted REAL intimacy with the people and world around us. I do think impersonal means of communication like writing and reading function to distance, which could reinforce this same subjectivity.

Chris, we see a lot of this sort of thing in the Indian online world - at social networks, at blogs and forums.  Its probably got a lot to do with how we are coping with this relatively new medium.  I come from a society that's so hierarchical in nature, that has very strong rules and sets of do's and don'ts, that has power balances rooted in tradition, that has little concept or value for personal space, and that doesnot always encourage team play.   

The online world is toppling and threatening many of our traditional structures, giving open voice and power to many who hitherto had none.  It's a world that is not hierarchical, one that encourages an even-playing field for free speech and debate no matter what gender or age or race or religion you belong to, it does not have many pre-ordained rules and prescriptions, it is one where we need to learn to respect personal space, and where team play can be so rewarding. 

Maybe we're in a state of Anomie as we transition - we're all learning ... the way i deal with it is to simply ignore obvious 'flamers', and not engage in a debate.  When you don't engage someone, they may knock harder for a while, but soon, they will go away.  Maybe the system self-corrects too?

(I found you via Sharon Boggon's http://www.inaminuteago.com/mindtracks/ blog)...I like Spinoza's theory, and would just simplify it:  where there is heat, there is personal projection of some kind of unfinished business.  Sometimes it is worth deciphering, sometimes not.

I loved what Dina Mehta said about the online world "encourages an even-playing field for free speech".  It has got to be a force for increased understanding among all people, flammage along the way or not.

Hey, Chris, your post reminded me of the concept of "egocasting" which I blogged about earlier this year.  

"egocasting: the act of using your ability to personalize and filter intermediated experience to make your world match who you already are"

As our technology continues to get better at helping us filter the world to fit our preferences, does our ability to understand and tolerate difference atrophy?

Are there ways to teach and encourage appreciation of difference through design of technology?  Or expand online messages to increase comprehension?

I agree with the comment above that this part of the nature of our subjective experience.  We all face the challenge of understanding each other regardless of the communication medium.

I suspect I may find a reference to Cialdini's book, "Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion" someplace on this blog, but I haven't yet, so I am going to throw it out there as good reading on the psychology of all this ("an innocent association with either bad things or good things will influence how people feel about us").

I got to your blog from an endorsement on your LinkedIn profile. Thank you for sharing this wonderful piece from Mick LaSalle. I blogged about it too on my business networking blog.

I also noticed that in your list of Social Networks on the sidebar, you haven't mentioned openBC - http://www.openbc.com , which is one of my two favorites for online networking [ the other being LinkedIn ].

<p>I was reading on <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> a discussion about <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/10/0235212">iTune 4.8</a> and its new capability to purchase videos from the iTunes Music Store, when I read two things that just made me say &quot;duh&quot; with their obviousness, yet I'd never thought of them before.</p>

<p>Both of these &quot;duh&quot; moments were inspired by the comments by an anonymous Apple engineer with the handle <a href="http://slashdot.org/~As%20Seen%20On%20TV">As Seen on TV</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Everybody's wrong about the video iPod thing. A video iPod would be a dumb idea for lots of reasons, some technical, some psychological. If you want to know where we're going with video playback, look not to the iPod but to its considerably less famous little brother, AirPort Express.</em></p></blockquote><p>He didn't explain himself further, but I grokked it immediately. The current <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express</a> already offers digital output of audio in a feature called &quot;AirTunes&quot;. It isn't much of a stretch to believe that they could add the capability to offer video. If they added a dedicated H.264/MPEG4 decoder chip to the Airport Express, you could just plug in an HD-capable monitor and offer internet delivery of video and movies. The bandwidth wouldn't be an issue, as you are talking only 2 Mbps for the most popular HD compressed format, and even the full resolution 1080i compressed only requires 8-9 Mbps -- all of which will fit amply the bandwidth available to 802.11g. Thus &quot;AirVideo&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;As Seen on TV&quot; continues with more insights on Apple's strategy:</p><blockquote><p><em>And the iPod is not repeat not gonna say it one more time not meant to be a video-playback device. It’s not even remotely designed for it. The iPod has a tiny hard drive that’s designed for embedded applications, and a 32 MB (I think it is) RAM buffer cache that’s optimized for dealing with song-sized chunks of data. That’s about 4 MB. Even a half hour of HD content is gonna be half a gigabyte. There’s basically no way for the iPod to play that without constantly keeping the hard drive running, and that will burn out the drive very quickly. Seriously, under constant use, the iPod hard drives’ life spans are measured in tens of hours.</em></p>

<p><em>(How can we do photos, then? Easy. Photos are even smaller than songs. And unlike video, people often do want to carry photos around with them. Keep reading.)</em></p>

<p><em>Remember when I said the problem was part technology and part psychology? People like to listen to music while they do other things: Ride on the train, exercise, shop. People like to multi-task with their music.</em></p>

<p><em>Video, whether short-form like TV or long-form like movies, isn’t like that. Video is an immersive experience. You sit down and you watch it, and you don’t do anything else until it’s over. That’s a totally different interaction model than music.</em></p>

<p><em>So there’s basically zero reason for video to be portable. You’re not going to carry it around with you. You’re going to watch it at home.</em></p>

<p><em>Exceptions? Sure. But Apple isn’t a company that makes a habit of marketing to the exceptions. We shoot for a pretty clearly defined target market and let the exceptions buy their gadgets somewhere else. Chiefly because there aren’t nearly enough exceptions out there to make it worth going after, financially speaking. We’d never be able to recover what we invest in R&amp;D and design by selling a few hundred thousand units. We have to sell millions of units per quarter, otherwise the business plan just doesn’t work.</em></p></blockquote><p>This all made sense, but it this comment that brought it home: </p><blockquote><p><em>All you have to do is pay attention to the way people interact with their media. The difference between immersive media and ambient media jump out at you immediately.</em></p></blockquote><p>I'd guess never really understood intuitively the concept that there are really two major media types: ambient and immersive. Now that I understand it, it seems obvious. I just never internalized the difference. Yes, sometimes TV is an ambient media, sometimes music is immersive, but only rarely. As I think about it more it makes me wonder about other types of ambient vs immersive media, such as games.</p>

<p>I'll close with more last quote from &quot;As Seen on TV&quot;: </p><blockquote><p><em>I know you’re going to say I’m being a dick here, but I’m going to give you the pure, unvarnished truth: </em></p>

<p><em>Neither Apple’s management nor Apple’s shareholders give a shit about what the “alpha geeks” think. </em></p>

<p><em>I know, I know. It’s harsh. But it’s absolutely true. See, the “alpha geeks” are not our market. We don’t sell to them. The “alpha geeks” are defined by one key characteristic: they’re irrational. Now, I’m not trying to insult you. I mean it literally. Geeks are not rational. They base their purchasing decisions on things that, from a rational point of view, just don’t make any sense. Things like politics, lack “openness,” like “customizability.” Things that just don’t add up in the cost-benefit analysis. </em></p>

<p><em>That’s fine. That’s totally legitimate. But it’s not our business.</em></p>

<p><em>We sell products to people who want them to work. We don’t sell products to people who want to take them apart. There are other companies that do that. We don’t seek to dominate them or to put them out of business. We don’t see them as competition at all, because the kinds of people who buy our products would never buy a motherboard. They’d never buy Linux. Never in a million years. </em></p>

<p><em>Is there some overlap? Sure. We love the fact that some prominent hard-core geeks use Macs. But we’re not going to abandon our business plan to woo them. We’re not going to turn our backs on the vast and untapped market for next-generation content delivery services, a market which we basically created, in order to please some Internet message board guys. </em></p>

<p><em>Again, I’m sorry for sounding so harsh here. I don’t mean to be rude. I’m just not going to sugar-coat it for you. You do your thing, whatever makes you happy. We’ll do ours.</em></p></blockquote>

The "ambient vs immersive" stuff is not new - it was what Steve Jobs called "background vs foreground activity", a point he made when called to comment on the possibility of video iPods, about a year ago or so.

(That said, this is an important and useful rule.)

As for this paragraph:
"And the iPod is not repeat not gonna say it one more time not meant to be a video-playback device. It’s not even remotely designed for it. The iPod has a tiny hard drive that’s designed for embedded applications, and a 32 MB (I think it is) RAM buffer cache that’s optimized for dealing with song-sized chunks of data. That’s about 4 MB. Even a half hour of HD content is gonna be half a gigabyte. There’s basically no way for the iPod to play that without constantly keeping the hard drive running, and that will burn out the drive very quickly. Seriously, under constant use, the iPod hard drives’ life spans are measured in tens of hours."

Disclosures:
1. I couldn't care less about a video iPod at the moment
2. I don't think these have a chance of success as it is

But, that said, why's he mentioning HD along with the iPod? Do I *have* to view the videos on my iPod in my HD format? What's wrong with compressed/lossy formats?

Do you *have* to listen to your tunes in uncompressed (WAV/AIFF) format when using your iPod?

Sure, we won't achieve tiny filesizes when compressing video, but we won't be near HD-territory either.

If you take this under consideration, this argument of his carries much less weight.

I've not purchased one, but now I'm quite curious about the level of movie immersiveness when using the Sony PSP http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx -- Sony is reportedly going to be offering 70+ movies for the PSP. If the experience is sufficiently immersive, then maybe that is the form factor for a "video iPod".

You don't have to watch videos on your videom iPod in HD, but files compressed down to iPod file size (< 10Mb) are going to be really, really crappy for any non-trivial piece.

I watched an iTMS video in small size and frankly, it was a chore.

One thing interested me:
"We sell products to people who want them to work."

Hm. Apple certainly sells iPods to people who want them to work. I reckon there's a large percentage of Mac owners who are power users, as compared to Wintel PCs and iPods (even ignoring the business space - we're just talking consumers here).

It's pretty obvious that regardless of what they call it Apple will offer a portable video player at SOME point in the future.

Do people want to watch video content on the go?  Other technology companies sure think so.  Even cell phones are starting to be able to display low-res video.  Sprint just launched a new campaign for NBC to go, etc.

And now the PSP brings high-quality video on the go in a small package.  

I watch videos on my Palm Tungsten more than I do on my laptop due to its portability.  I can compress PVRed video from the night before while I'm in the shower and watch the shows on my Palm while I'm on the train.  I'd love to have something that was a little more robust in terms of video decompression (i.e. with a dedicated hardware GPU that could decompress Divx on the fly) and Palm's new "Lifedrive" 4Gb model will work pretty well for my needs, I think, but a 100Gb video iPod would be even better if they could dedicate hardware to video encoding/decoding.

HD is still years away from a portable because the small screen resolutions are still pretty low.  The PSP seems about the best portable video has to offer at this time, but there are other portable media center devices that also work well.

And the sales of those little portable DVD players with screens are through the roof.

So Apple can't be blind to the fact that people do want video on the go.

Portable video has a mass appeal and not just to alpha geeks, but the ambient/immersive distinction does make sense.

Would also be nice if it had better games them pong!

Whether Apple will choose to go there in the near future, I don't know, but as for this statement: 

"You sit down and you watch it, and you don’t do anything else until it’s over. That’s a totally different interaction model than music."

I think this is a little short sited, all told.

The reason we have that model is that we've never had portable video devices. There are already ways to extract information from our environments with digital cameras [1], why should we assume there will be no new applications of portable video?

I hadn't seen that addition to the site!  Thanks for writing about it.  I do the same thing on my blog, only with my Furl.net selections (similar tool, more options I think, more friendly UI).

You might enjoy checking out the folks over at http://marketingstudies.net too.  They first alerted me to the possibility of using RSS like this, and though they are all about corporate marketing, they come up with many good ideas.

Thanks for your blog, allways a pleasure to read.

I was delighted to see that your first del.icio.us posting linked to W. Ross Ashby's An Introduction to Cybernetics. I devoured that book when it was first published in 1956, and I was a 28 year old ad copywriter. I worked through all the examples and laughed like mad over ex. 4/15, the letter which begins, "Dear Friend, some years ago I bought this old house, but found it to be haunted by two ghostly noises -- a ribald Singing and a sardonic Laughter ... ". I copied it out by hand and sent copies round my friends as an Xmas card that year. I don't think any of them had the faintest idea what I was on about. I still have the sixth impression of that book beside me now. 

My first acquaintance with the subject must have been with Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics in 1948, while I was still an undergraduate. I understood little of it, but it did introduce me to Russell's Paradox.

I must add these to my own del.icio.us collection plus a couple of other books on symbolic logic, which deeply impressed me at the time. I've only just discovered your blog, through John Robb, and I will add your site to my own blog Junkyard Whirlwind. You have led me to a most interesting cluster of concepts, and must explore further. Many thanks.

BODY:
<p>I've been working on an ambitious list of topics that I'd like to cover over the next year. I offer them to you here so you can have some idea the areas that I am thinking about.</p>

<p><strong><em>Office Architecture for Innovation</em></strong> -- Over the years I've built or converted three offices to my specifications. From this I have learned a number of things about about how to create a productive environment innovation-oriented businesses. These include some of the obvious suggestions such as fresh air and natural light, but also include not so obvious ideas such as using magnetic paint and providing a small washer-dryer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Requisite Variety</em></strong> -- This concept from cybernetics applies to social systems as well. &quot;The larger the variety of actions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.&quot; More people, as well as a diversity of thinking styles and experience, give social software more &quot;variety of actions&quot;, thus this is part of the reason why social software can be so effective.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Art and Craft of Meme Design</em></strong> -- We are learning more about how to create an effective meme. Creating memes has always been an art performed by publicists, marketers, politicians, the press, and to a lesser extent by scientists and other academics. Have we learned enough to turn this art into an explicit craft?</p>

<p><strong><em>Wiki Editing Dichotomy</em></strong> -- One interesting possible barrier of entry to active participation in a wiki is what I call the &quot;wiki editing dichotomy&quot;. You have to be proud enough to believe what you are contributing is generally worthwhile to others (or at least worth your effort), but you also have to be humble enough to understand that others can improve it. I don't know of many other collaborative media that requires both pride and humility.</p>

<p><strong><em>Choice &amp; Neuroeconomics</em></strong> -- There are some that say at the root of every decision is emotion. Even a 'rational' decision appeals to a sense of balance or beauty. Recent studies using PET are establishing a neurological basis for emotions, and some reveal interesting facts about how we make choices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Assessing Risk</em></strong> -- There are a variety of areas where we as humans have a difficult time being completely rational. One of these is risk assessment. It turns out we may be hard-wired to not be able toeasily understand risk that is greater then one in a hundred or so. Thus a very rare risk, say one in a thousand, will often be emotionally interpreted as having a much higher risk.</p>


<p><strong><em>Persuasive Computing</em></strong> -- BJ Fogg's group at Stanford has done some interesting research on how computers can persuade you to do something. There are a number of useful ideas that come from this research. There are also some ethical considerations that should be discussed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cognitive Dissonance</em></strong> -- This technique is central to many forms of persuasion intended to change beliefs, values, attitudes and behaviors. It is used by facilitators, businesses, military organizations, and even cults. It can be used positively or negatively. How might it be used in social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>The Dark Side of the Force</em></strong> -- The same social tools that we use for good, can also be used for harm. How do we ethically use what we are learning about social software? Some say that almost by definition social software attracts spammers, trolls, and innappropriate sexuality. What can we do to prevent these misuses of social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Conversation vs Communication</em></strong> -- Update and rewrite of my <a href="http://www.alacritymanagement.com/GCnC.html">1990 essay</a> on how social software design needs to balance conversation vs communication.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Emotions</em></strong> -- We appear to have evolved a number of emotions that appear primarily to exist to support a common good, rather then to ensure our individual success. These include schadenfreude, mirth, naches, revenge, shame, pride, outrage, approbation, admiration, elevation, etc. Studies by Eckman on unconscious facial gestures, studies on the neurological basis for emotions, and studies on emotions in games, are proving that these social emotions exist. A number of them have interesting implications on social software.</p>

<p><strong><em>Glances &amp; Strokes</em></strong> -- There is some old work on the amount of eye contact we make with others in small groups, as well as some research from transactional analysis on strokes, which are the amount of recognition given to others through words and deeds. Is there a neurological basis for needing a certain number of glances and strokes each day? How does this concept apply to social software?</p>

<p><strong><em>Weak Links</em></strong> -- There are some interesting social implications behind what we've learned about weak links in social networks. How do we identify and encourage weak links in our social software systems?</p>

<p><strong><em>Negativity vs Positivity</em></strong> -- It is far easier for someone to respond negativel than positively. In political systems it is far easier to say no rather then yes. What social software encourages positivity, and is it possible to design social software to do so?</p>

<p><strong><em>Time Economy</em></strong> -- Our ultimate most unrenewable resource is time. How time and attention are a basic economic unit that should be considered when looking at social software.</p>


<p><strong><em>Group Life Cycle</em></strong> -- We often focus on how groups form, emerge, and grow. Yet there are many lessons to be learned from how groups die, including that it isn't necessarily a bad thing and that keeping a group from death can be dysfunctional.</p>

<p><strong><em>Groupthink</em></strong> -- What causes groupthink? When is it good and when is it bad?</p>


<p><strong><em>Two Thresholds in the Value of Knowledge</em></strong> -- In order for knowledge to be valuable, it must at minimum be more valuable then the costs to find and absorb it (costs which include bandwidth and attention). Tools like Google have tremendously increased the amount of knowledge that is worth the time and attention to find it. What types of knowledge fall below this threshold of value? Is there a limit to how much we can lower this line? Furthermore, there is another threshold where the knowledge is significantly more valuable than only bandwidth and attention. How much have internet tools impacted this second threshold? Many internet business models, in particular content models, require some ability to offer value in this upper threshold -- can they survive as this upper threshold changes?</p>

<p><strong><em>Intimacy and Social Networks</em></strong> -- Social Networks Analysis tends to focus on the connections between people, either explicitly through acknowledgement of connections (LinkedIn, Friendster) or implicitly through analysis of your communication (Spoke). None are able to measure intimacy. Yet our intimate social networks are an important component of our overall happiness and contentment within both our professional and personal lives. How does intimacy work in social networks? Also there are some concepts in psychology known as communal vs exchange relationships by Clark &amp; Mills from late 70's that may apply here.</p>

<p><strong><em>Social Games</em></strong> -- A recap of Shannon Appelcline's and my analysis of the basic forms of social games types. These include relatively well understood ones like majority control, voting, meta-voting (Nomic), auctioning, etc., but also include less well understood games like playing of roles, dominance and submission, etc. There are also links to social emotions, such as mirth and schadenfraude.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Castle Marrach</em></strong> -- We released the Castle Marrach online game in September of 2000, and it was designed from the beginning to be a game for the Bartle-type known as &quot;the socializer&quot;. What lessons did we learn in the five years since the release of the game? What tools are in my social software toolbox today that might have helped with the design?</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from F2F Facilitation</em></strong> -- There are many skilled practitioners of face-to-face facilitation, some of which are paid very high fees for their skills. What lessons can we learn from their experience that we can apply to social software? Why have so many of these facilitators failed to have success online?</p>

<p><strong><em>More Human vs More Than Human</em></strong> -- Many futurists seek to offer us augmentation of our minds and bodies through technology. Many of these ideas may fundamentally change what it is to be human, and may even have unforeseen complications unanticipated by their creators. One interesting approach to looking at these technologies is to examine which make us &quot;more human&quot;, rather then &quot;more than human&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><em>Lessons from Mental Disorders</em></strong> -- Most, if not all, mental disorders have their roots in survival strategies; however, they are over-expressed because of genetic or other causes. Examining the healthy behaviors hiding behind depression, autism, mania, schizophrenia, paranoia, etc. offer a number of insights on how we think.</p>

<p><strong><em>Joy of being a Primate</em></strong> -- If you scan the surface of my writing, you may observe that I have a strong belief that our animal nature and genetics form an essential and often unconscious part of what it is to be human. You could interpret these &quot;nature&quot; over &quot;nurture&quot; ideas as limiting us to being just animals. Instead, I believe that by becoming aware of our primate nature, and choosing to leverage it or suppress it by conscious choice rather then letting it drive us unaware, is what makes us more powerful.</p>

<p><strong><em>Smart Contracts</em></strong> -- Nick Szabo popularized the idea of using some of the primitives of cryptography in unique ways to create what he calls &quot;smart contracts&quot;. He hypothesized approaches to cryptographic handling of collateral, bonding, delineation of property, bearer certificates, and much more. Others have proposed various auction protocols using these concepts. One of the fundamental atomic elements of many of these smart contracts is something called a &quot;reusable proof of work&quot;, which Hal Finney recently demoed a version of at CodeCon 2005. What are the possibilities offered by smart contracts? What are the barriers to implementation?</p>

<p><strong><em>Club System</em></strong> -- In the 80's, development of Ted Nelson's Xanadu vision was being financed by Autodesk. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons Xanadu failed to deliver any technology. However, a couple of their ideas could be valuable today, one of which is the concept of an alternative to the &quot;user and groups&quot; metaphor for computer security. Xanadu turned that idea upside down and called the result the &quot;club system&quot;. The club system approach is particularly suited to the internet based collaboration tools, in particular wikis. I also have some insights to offer a cryptographic approach to the club system, which might allow P2P distribution of collaborative documents, while preserving group privileges.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edges of Cryptographic Security</em></strong> -- The SSL cryptographic protocol offers a choice of a number of security properties: integrity, confidentiality, encryption, one-party authentication, and two-party authentication. But there are a number of security properties that very few deployed cryptographic protocols offer. These include perfect forward secrecy, undeniability, deniability, authorization, delegation, multi-party authentication, shared secrets, etc. What are these security properties and how are they useful? Why have they not been successfully broadly deployed?</p>

<p><strong><em>The SSL Story</em></strong> -- When SSL was first proposed it was broken within an hour. Even when Netscape fixed those problems, it wasn't clear that SSL was going to win the battle of security protocols. SSL was competing against SHTTP which had backing of RSA and an industry consortium. The credit card companies merged their standards and were backing SET. The internet community was moving toward SSH. Microsoft was doing its own embrace and extend protocol PCT. So how did SSL win to become the broadest deployed cryptographic security protocol? The answers may surprise you.</p>

BODY:
<p>In my post about the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a> I offered some evidence on the levels of satisfaction of various group sizes based on some empirical data from online games. There I was able to show that even though the Dunbar Number might predict a mean group size of 150 for humans, that in fact for non-survival oriented groups the mean was significantly less, probably between 60 to 90.</p>

<p><a href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/groupsatisfaction.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=436,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="400" height="272" border="0" alt="Groupsatisfaction" title="Groupsatisfaction" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/groupsatisfaction.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
I also offered a second hypothesis, that there is a dip in satisfaction level of groups at around the size of 15. Unfortunately, I could only offer anecdotal evidence that this threshold existed. My personal belief was that this dip was caused by not enough &quot;attention&quot; being given to everyone and that group gatherings of this size risk becoming too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Yet groups of this size are not large enough to allow for different perspectives (i.e. insufficient <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/REQVAR.html">requisite variety</a>) or for other group processes to come into play.</p>

<p>I was reading through the current (12 March) issue of <em>New Scientist</em>, and found an interesting table in the article <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18524901.600">Charity Begins at Homo Sapiens</a>. It stood out to me as it showed a dip approaching zero average cooperation for group sizes of 16 -- almost precisely same place that my hypothesis predicted.</p>

<p>Digging further, I found the original source for this table was published in <em>Nature</em> back in October 2003, in <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/papers/NatureOfHumanAltruism.pdf">The Nature of Human Altruism</a> written by <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/">Ernst Fehr</a> and <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fischbacher/">Urs Fischbacher</a>.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=495,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif"><img width="400" height="309" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1.gif" title="Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1" alt="Nature_of_human_altruism_fig_4_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: left;" /></a>What the chart shows is actually not empirical data from human experiments, but instead data from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a> simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>. This is the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum">zero-sum game</a> where if you cooperate, the joint payoff of the players is higher. However, in zero-sum games there is also incentive for the players to cheat by defecting and thus taking less risk. Robert Axelrod showed in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465021212/102-0974708-1794504">The Evolution of Cooperation</a> back in 1985 that in spite of the statistical best individual strategy being that of defection, cooperation inevitably evolves.</p>

<p>Fehr and Fischbacher, in their <em>Nature</em> article, took this idea a bit further by creating 100 independent simulations with group sizes ranging from 2 to 512, and then executing each simulation 1,000 to 2,000 times. Each generation of the &quot;players&quot; was allowed to evolve different strategies of cooperation vs defection, the classic successful strategy being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat">Tit for Tat</a>. They would then evaluate the percentage of players who had cooperative strategies.</p>

<p>If punishment of defections was ruled out, they discovered that over the 1,000+ generations of the simulation that the rate of cooperation quickly crashes, such that at the group size of 8 a little over 50% cooperation evolved, and for groups that are larger than 16 none cooperate.</p>

<p>Next they added to the simulation &quot;<a name="altruistic_punishment">Altruistic Punishment</a>&quot;. This is the ability for players to punish those who did not cooperate -- however, such punishment is at some cost to the punisher. Earlier game theory <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/get_doc.pl?urn=RePEc:wpa:wuwpmi:0305006&amp;url=http://econwpa.wustl.edu:8089/eps/mic/papers/0305/0305006.pdf">research on altruistic punishment</a> has shown that cooperation flourishes if there is some price for punishing defectors -- if you allow punishment at no cost then cheating strategies emerge. This earlier research determined that allowing individuals to punish at some cost that yields them no material gain will paradoxically result in an average gain for everyone.</p>

<p>Adding altruistic punishment to the simulation increased the amount of cooperation that evolved, such that groups with the size of 32 would have 50% cooperation. But even this had limits; at the group size of 128 no cooperation would evolve.</p>

<p>Finally, if they added to the simulation the ability to punish those who did not participate in punishing (i.e. didn't pay the cost to punish defectors), then the percentage of cooperation that evolved was never less then 60%, and in fact got better as groups got larger.</p>

<p>This is a very interesting result. To explain it in different terms, if you have a system that depends on sharing some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">commons</a> and there are no process or trust metrics, a group as small as 16 may find themselves not cooperating very effectively.</p>

<p>The idea of commons can be as simple as how much speaking time participants in a meeting share. The time that each participant uses during the meeting can be considered the shared &quot;commons&quot;. If there are no enforced rules, with a group size of 16 there will inevitably be someone who will abuse the time and speak more than their share.</p>

<p>With some simple rules (some type of process to partition time more fairly), or through some trust metrics (punish those who abuse the commons), larger groups can gain value from cooperating, but even these groups have limits. As long as there is some effort required to punish those who abuse the process, eventually the price for that effort becomes too high, and no one is willing to punish any longer. You see this in moderated discussion groups, where the guardians of the common good have to spend too much time moderating, given the number of people that wish to participate. Moderated newsgroups and early versions of SlashDot moderation had this problem.</p>

<p>The most interesting observation from this simulation is that for larger groups, you needed to have a system to punish those who did not participate in punishing -- or to put it another way, get everyone involved with the process, not just a few. I think that this explains something that I've always wondered about SlashDot's <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MetaModeration">meta-moderation</a> system -- with this feature you grade those who have moderated, and if someone abuses it they will no longer be able to moderate. What I suspect, given these results, is that if you don't participate in the meta-moderation system, you have less a chance of being able to moderate; thus SlashDot has a system that punishes those who are not involved in participating.</p>

<p>I do have some questions based on this simulation -- I would like to see results with more granularity then powers of 2. I'd also like to know the percentage of players participating in punishment -- I suspect that you'll find a very small number of &quot;moderators&quot; are required in the middle graph, even when cooperation evolves successfully. I'm curious as to how many moderators are required to participate in punishing the non-punishers for cooperation to evolve in the third scenario. Also, in meta-moderation this simulation emphasizes punishing the non-punishers -- is that as successful as rewarding the punishers? I'm also interested in investigating some of the further works where Fehr and Fischbacher are among the co-authors, such as this <a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/home/fehr/science/Altruistic_Punishment.pdf">study</a> using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) that shows that our brain's pleasure systems are activated when we altruistically punish.</p>

<p>I'm sure that the findings of this simulation are not the only reason why there might be a dip in group satisfaction at group sizes around 15, such as I observed. However, it does offer some interesting insights into group size thresholds, both for the threshold at 15 and for threshold of non-survival groups which I've identified as being significantly less then the Dunbar mean of 150. It also shows that for large groups we need to offer not only moderation, but meta-moderation capabilities that involve all the participants in the process.</p>

<p>In summary this research offers me another widget for my social software toolbox: in any group process look for the commons, allow participants to participate in identifing defectors; determine what the costs are for such identification (which may be as simple as requiring some attention or charging for such punishment); and encourage participation in the common good by punishing those who do not participate in seeking out defectors.</p>

You may be onto something. The Dunbar number was referred to in the Tipping Point and in some places plays a role in tribal-forming. But for smaller activities the number 15 seems ideal, eg, for a classroom or workshop. If there's under 10 or 12, regardless of the room size people want to bail out because there doesn't seem to be "enough" people. Much over 15 and the group dynamic must change to lecture style as if there were 50 or 100 people.

Association Football ("soccer") and cricket teams are 11 strong and are organised by a single player, the captain.  Rugby Union sides are 15 strong, and the organising job is split: the forwards are led by a "pack leader" who is subject to the team captain.  Any significance?

A superb blog Chris, but just a few errata on the post.
First the simulation in Fehr,et al is a multi-person prisoner's dilemma--a public goods game--which is identical to the game in the "research on altruistic punishment" link which I think is a great introduction to the literature.
Second, the prisoner's dilemma is not a zero-sum game although often times mis-attributed as such. In zero-sum games, the total payoff in each possible outcome must be the same; thus, your gain must be my loss. The tragedy of the prisoner's dilemma is simply that cooperate is not a good strategy for either player.
Third, I think the sentence with the "research on altruistic punishment" link should be "... cooperation flourishes EVEN if there is a cost to punishing defectors." The later part of the sentence is incorrect. However, the result is still paradoxical as under the notion of rationality one would not expect anyone to incur the cost of punishing another without any personal profit.
Finally, although this research seems to be one capable of addressing organizational size, it is actually quite incapable of that feat. The number 16 on the graph is really a coincidence of circumstances see the graph in http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/SecondOrderFreeRidePublished.pdf for the impact of parameter values on the model. Actually, coincidence is not quite correct; it was a deliberate selection by the researchers. This literature is designed to unshackle economics from the rational agent paradigm not to address optimal organizational size.
I will try to see if there are more pertinent experimental research addressing the Dunbar number question and post them, but I'm somewhat doubtful as the experimental design is still too limited to study such a complex phenomenon. I had thought to try to run such an experiment myself a year ago, but abandoned the idea. I think an econometric analysis of the online games data is probably the most promising course.

is the supposed cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable social relationships: the kind of relationships that go with knowing who each person is and how each person relates socially to every other person. Proponents assert that group sizes larger than this generally require more restricted rules, laws, and enforced policies and regulations to maintain a stable cohesion.

<p>I'm a keynote speaker for the <a href="http://www.nvhainnovations.org/2005/index.htm">FVHA (Future of Voluntary Health Associations) Conference</a>
in Atlanta today. My job is to give to this community a gentle
introduction and overview of concepts and products related to Social
Software and Social Networking. (<a href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/FVHA_Social_Software_Keynote_Presentation.pdf">My slides are here - 6.6MB .pdf</a>)</p>

<p>

In my research about this community, I find that they have some unique and interesting problems.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acsrelay.jpg" title="Acsrelay" alt="Acsrelay" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />

The attendees of this conference are a collection of VPs and national
directors from major Voluntary Health Associations such as American
Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, March of
Dimes, etc. In turn, these Voluntary Health Associations organize
communities in order to raise funds for, and inform the public about
the medical implications for the different health problems that each are
concerned with. These associations have an organized volunteer base of
over five million people and raise in excess of two billion dollars
annually. They all have dedicated and diverse volunteer communities
which include practicing MDs, scientific researchers, health educators,
business executives, and working and nonworking mothers.</p>

<p>

I think it is the quantity of people served, the diversity of their
communities, and in particular, the need to dive deep into information
that makes these Voluntary Health Associations interesting. A women diagnosed
with breast cancer will need to make educated decisions about her own
health care in order to give informed consent. Yet she may not have the
education experience or background to understand the care decisions she
must make. She may not even have a current era computer. There are
few other online communities that need their members to understand so
deeply such difficult problems.</p>

<p>
Thus the desire of these associations to look deeper in to Social
Software. Of course, their key interest is in better understanding,
motivating, and expanding their volunteer networks. They are already
experts in the business of organizing traditional communities, but now
they have to deal with the changing nature of communities as their
members are now using the internet as the primary source of
information.</p>

<p>

Ideally Social Software can help increase their sense of touch with
their volunteers, it can empower volunteers to collaborate and work
harder and in new ways, it can increase information sharing and
innovation, and it can help drive fund-raising numbers higher.</p>

<p>But the
openness of social software comes with a price. For instance, many of
these associations are afraid of enabling even simple unmoderated
discussion lists, in fear that bad or inappropriate information would be shared. There are also legitimate concerns about the quality, audience level, and attributation for even correct information. In the Q&amp;A after my presentation I tried to explain how, when looking at individual blogs, or individual events of info vandalism, it is not really relevant if the communities and processes behind the Social Software are able to correct or filter those events. This is a difficult point to get across, as it requires people to learn to trust a system where the squeaky wheels and trolls are the loudest.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/acslogowhite.gif" title="Acslogowhite" alt="Acslogowhite" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />

One particular interesting thing about this conference is that
it is one of the first between multiple associations. I know from some
other non-profits that I'm working with that they often feel in
competition for funds and resources from other non-profits, so I
applaud the American Cancer Society for sponsoring this cross-pollination effort.</p>

<p>As someone who now has over 171 professional &quot;connections&quot; in my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn Profile</a>, 198 &quot;friends&quot; on <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a>, many more non-intersecting friends and acquaintances on&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/">LiveJournal</a>, and <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/sns-meta-list/">other social networking services</a>, as well as a plethora of correspondents that I only interact with via email, I am trying reconcile a mismatch between my connections and my own <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>How do I maintain meaningful relationships with over 300 people?</p>

<p>Venture Capitalist <a href="http://sapventures.typepad.com/main/2004/02/quality_or_quan.html">Jeff Nolan</a> relates similar concerns:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
&quot;It strikes me that the social networking theory holds that the more volume you have, the bigger your network will become by introducing degrees of separation roughly along the lines of Metcalfe's Law. I disagree, human networks do not grow in value by multiplying, but rather by reduction. For me, it's the quality of relationships that enhances my professional and personal life, not the sheer numbers.&quot;
</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately social networking services -- be it LinkedIn, Tribe.Net, Orkut, or LiveJournal -- are making the problem worse, not solving it. Any engineer or information theorist can tell you that a system that only has amplifiers will be out of balance, and that you need attenuators in the system as well. Our current breed of social networking services have focused on amplifying our contacts not only because it serves us, but because it serves them. The more contacts that you make, the more people they potentially have in their service. However, in the long run this is unsustainable -- a social networking service also has to be useful -- merely amplifying your contacts isn't enough.</p>

<p>Thus the problem becomes not just one unique to me, where my friends network is overextended, but rather one that's endemic to the current generation of social networking services. In order to solve it we need to look at the traditional cultural answers to the problem, compare them to technical solutions, both current and to-be-invented, and then see how a new generation of social networking services can be designed that molds the two ideas together into a more cohesive whole.</p>

<p>I offer here the beginning of that discussion.</p>

<h4>The Cultural Strategies</h4>

<p>The problem of overextended social networks are not new with the Internet generation. Many professions require maintaining a large base of relationships and have done so for hundreds of years, among them: politicians, salespeople, public company CEOs, and even professions that you might not think of requiring these skills such as family doctors. The Dunbar Number of 150 may be a kind of species-wide average limit, it is not an individual limit -- thus my guess is that people with an innate talent for maintaining more relationships are attracted to these professions. But even with innate talent those who follow these professions can be overwhelmed, and each have found different cultural strategies for managing larger numbers of relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Spending More Time:</strong> Some people just spend a lot more time keeping up with their connections. Politicians and salespeople are classic examples of professions that require significant schmoozing time in order to keep trusted connections together.</p>

<p>How does someone like a member of the US House of Representatives manage their relationships? In no way can they even come close to having a relationship with all the 645,952 people they represent. They would, however, at least have to keep up at some level with the other 435 House members, their own staff, key members of the staff of other House members, as well as key politicians and contacts back home. From what I've read, successful politicians spend most of their days just meeting with people, and have staff dedicated to &quot;tickling&quot; -- keeping track of constituents, schedules, issues, etc. and reminding the politician before each meeting of the essentials they need to know.</p>

<p>The cost of this strategy is twofold -- the time spent managing relationships can't be spent elsewhere, and the quantity of relationships lowers the quality of those relationships. For instance, my experience with most politicians and many salesperson is that I will be forgotten as soon as I leave the room.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Changing the Standard:</strong> There are different cultural standards in each profession as to what is an acceptable relationship. Thus some people chooose a profession that manages relationships in different ways. Doctors are a good example of socializers who fit into this category.</p>

<p>Your family doctor has a similar problem to that of politicians -- too many people to keep track of. Yet a good family practitioner can see you and look beyond just today's symptoms. Thus because of an ongoing relationship with you he can be a better doctor.</p>

<p>The way the doctor does this is through cultural and professional limits. Because of the authority, status and title granted to doctors, patients tend to defer to them. There is not an expectation that the relationship is equal. This allows the doctor to have a 'shallower' relationship with the patient that is still acceptable.</p>

<p>Still, even this level of serial, shallow socialization can be excessive for many people. A Radiologist acquaintance of mine told me the reason why she ended up in her specialty was that she just couldn't handle the ongoing patient relationships required by other specialities -- instead, she now looks at one set of images at a time, performs a diagnosis, and doesn't have to retain any relationship to move on to the next patient.</p>

<p>There are also problems with changing your socialization standards. Unless it is culturally understood, or your standard is reciprocated by others, it can make you appear shallow and not trustworthy. I've seen this when someone moves from one profession to another, say a salesperson to a manager -- styles of relationships that were acceptable among salesperson and between salespeople and customers are not quite as acceptable as those between managers and their staff. Another example is when someone moves from the East Coast to the West Coast, where the usefulness of casual alumni connections is significantly less valued, but those casual connections are unable to understand the change in standards.</p>

<p><strong>Cultural Strategy - Prioritization:</strong> Perhaps a more common cultural strategy for managing excessive relationships is prioritization. I could prioritize my relationships and focus only on the 100+ or so that might be the most useful to me.</p>

<p>There are two problems with prioritizing. First, analyses of social networks show that it is often the weak and most unrelated links that can be <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1333462/0">the most important</a>. Thus any attempt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage">triage</a> may cut off some of these weak ties because I thought that the links might not be &quot;useful&quot;.</p>

<p>Secondly, how do you tell someone &quot;I'm sorry, but I'm overly Dunbarred, so I have removed you from my list.&quot; Rejection is painful (as <a href="http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/mripain01.htm">MRI brain studies</a> have actually shown), so I risk offending people forever by excluding them today.</p>

<h4>The Technological Solutions</h4>

<p>One of the great hopes of social networking services is to improve the ways that we interact with other people, particularly those that we know at a distance -- the &quot;weak links&quot;. Right now, these services are part of the problem because they offer out-of-balance social systems. However, they can also be part of the solution; science-fiction writers and social software designers alike are starting to look at these issues and offer new solutions that would not have been possible before the advent of widespread software communication systems.</p>

<p><strong>Technological Solution - Augmentation:</strong> <img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/geodesica.jpg" title="Geodesica" alt="Geodesica" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" />I recently read in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a>, a new science fiction novel by Sean Williams and Shane Dix, a futurist example of augmentation as a method of maintaining extended social networks.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441012698/qid=1107286515/sr=8-1/ref=skotos_20/102-0974708-1794504?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Geodesica: Ascent</a> the protagonist, &quot;Melilah&quot; is a politician in the distant future. She has her own problems with the Dunbar Number, and solves it with her own personalized social networking service:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Two things she had learned from her political career were that society depended on interpersonal relationship networks, and that everything could turn on a simple misidentification. In her fifties she had set about ensuring that her memory remained in good working order in order to avoid the latter. Anthropologists had known since the twentieth century that people were born with a ceiling on their social groups. Once Melilah exceeded the Dunbar and Hill number of 150, and rapidly acquiring still more associates, it became progressively harder to keep track of everyone she had to know. As she passed her hundredth birthday, it became only worse. Some of her contemporaries option for cortical grafts and other memory prosthetics. She, motivated by a gut-level -- some would say irrational -- desire to keep her body as free of technology as possible, opted for other means.</em></p>

<p><em>She had found that using a name once every two months was enough to keep her memory fresh. Any longer than that between reminders, and the associations faded, rendering recall unreliable. So she programmed a complete list of her occasional acquaintances and enemies into a database and programmed it to cycle through them ever sixty days, shuffling the order each time.</em></p>

<p><em>A hundred years on, she was still in the habit of skimming fifty or so names a day, just to keep on the ball. By flicking through the images, voice files, place names, and more obtuse clues, she felt confident of recognizing any of the several thousand people more or less likely to interact with her at any point in the near future. The list had grown and shrunk down over the years, and many people had dropped off it entirely because of death or distance. Sometimes she added names to the list only to be surprised that they had been on it once before, decades ago, and she had forgotten them completely. That only reinforced the need for the list and the effort to keep it fresh in her mind.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure that the Dunbar Number problem is solely one of &quot;recognition&quot;, as illustrated by Williams and Dix. However, I think this is a great example of seeing how a traditional cultural solution to network overextension (namely, &quot;Spending More Time&quot;) can be better applied by Social Software. In this example Melilah's software automates the &quot;ticklers&quot; that politicians use.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/spokekeepintouchsettings.gif" title="Spokekeepintouchsettings" alt="Spokekeepintouchsettings" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;" />Already at least one social networking service has adopted a somewhat similar idea.
<a href="http://center.spoke.com/person/personalProfileTab.spoke?id=[serverID=center,ID=4877427]">Spoke</a> has a &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; setting. The Spoke client software will watch your Outlook mailbox and addressbook to see how often you contact various people, and if you don't email them or modify your address book entry for them periodically, will remind you that you should contact them.</p>

<p>I've never used Spoke's &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; feature -- largely for privacy reasons (I was <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html">stung by a Zero Degrees</a> Outlook extension), but also because Spoke seemed to be oriented toward salespeople and thus emphasized growing the network. My problem is not growing my network, but managing the network I already have more effectively. But I may have to take another look at Spoke. So, it doesn't quite offer the same solution that Melilah used in the far-future, but it's still a start upon that path.</p>

<h4>Conclusions and Questions</h4>

<p>I'm not certain that Spoke's &quot;Keep In Touch&quot; feature, or Melilah's social recognition reminder service are the full solution to the &quot;Dunbar Triage&quot; problem. However, they do at least offer a few examples of people looking at the problems, and how social software can help solve them.</p>

<p>As I've outlined here there are at least three traditional methods&nbsp; that we've used to manage Dunbar Triage prior to advent of social networking services: spending more time, changing standards, and prioritization. The technological solutions that I've offered up as an example concentrates upon the first of those cultural solutions, but it is by no means a conclusive statement on the issue.</p>

<p>How could next-generation social networking services improve upon the ideas of changing standards or prioritization? Could simple categorization help improve expectations for attention levels that various associates receive from you? Are there ways that social networking services, acting as an intermediary, could better manage disappointment-inducing events, such as a decision to spend less attention on an associate?</p>

<p>More so, could social software offer solutions that aren't even being considered right now? For example, many Cyberpunk novels have suggested the ideas of avatars that can collect information for you on the 'net while your attention is elsewhere. Could these avatars likewise maintain more distant social networks for you, without your full attention? Would that function even be desirable?</p>

<p>Some solutions are not technological -- what new skills and changes to practices, etiquette and ethics are required for our ever expanding network of relationships? Or as <a href="http://alevin.com/weblog/">Adina</a> asks: <em>&quot;Who will offer us a 21st century, internet-augmented take on Dale Carnegie and Emily Post?&quot;</em></p>

<p>As with any problem in the developing technical world, the first step is to define the problem and to consider possible solutions. Here's the start: social networks can become too large, and many social networking services are causing the problem rather than solving it.</p>

<p>What's your solution?</p>

I think the politicians and sales people use another strategy - they pretend that they keep up with the connections, but in fact they don't.

That's why they have the people to keep them informed about people they are going to meet. They don't remember the people but they use techniques to impress them that they do. And that is why we don't like them.

YASNS let us all switch into the politician networking mode.

For some time I have beed thinking that Huminity which bases the networking on IM buddy lists is a step in the direction of making SNS more balanced, since it bases the networking on the most scarce Internet resource - user attention.

Nice post. A few random thoughts:  

This seems analogous to what happens when people move from rural communities with relatively sparse social options to the city. 

Another prioritization scheme is to emphasize face to face relationships, or to distinguish between real-time and non-realtime relationships. These are not always appropriate filters, but because getting f2f or talking realtime requires a special effort, I've found these approaches can help me gauge whether a relationship is maintainable. 

The older system of etiquette, which separated personal from professional relationships, is another approach, though when I hear the words "I don't do business with friends," it means someone neither a friend nor a business associate. 

Perhaps there are some other frames for looking at this, e.g. time management or attention management, or as another instance of the Tyranny of Choice.  Approaching the problem as one of more choice in who we pick to be our friends and associates, or as one of more demand on us from others also colors our choice of solutions.

One way of putting the brakes on endlessly expanding contact lists is to have the SNS site charge per contact. If you really need more than 100 contacts then you'd pay for them, but if not then when you've got another 1 person you want to add to your list you'd consider dropping one off your current list. It might work better with per-contact charges, so you're not forced into making a decision when you hit the package borders (101, 201, etc)

Not only does it counter the pack-rat mentality, but it also provides a business model.

Another idea I had was if the SNS would provide me with a continuous feed of updates and changes in the profiles of my contacts - I occasionally notice that some contact of mine has changed jobs, but more likely I wouldn't notice. The list of contacts just sit there, passive. This feedback would provide two forces: (1) the memory refreshing effect, and (2) the opportunity to drop those contacts that are moving into areas I don't care for.

A third idea: I'd like it if the SNS I use (LinkedIn) allowed me to attach some notes or tags to each contact in my list ... I have a few there where I have to think really hard just how I happen to know them. Right now it seems that every SNS I look at lets me make connections, but every connection is bland and generic. The system is relying on me remembering why I know that person, when instead it could remember it for me.

When it comes time to triage, I'd really like it if the SNS would provide a simple network map for me. Show me my immediate contacts, any connections they have amongst themselves, and my second circle contacts (anonymised if necessary). This way at least I can see that Person X is a gatekeeper to a whole different community from all my other contacts, and so should reconsider dropping them.

Eric Scheid has the right idea... but his number of 100 is still too high.

His last paragraph is golden.  When I first joined RYZE  in 2002 [ no longer an active member] I mapped out my 1 and 2 step network there.  In the diagram linked below I am the green node, my immediate neighbors are in blue and my two step contacts are in grey. 

The network map reveals why Eric's 100 number is too high...

This, and the earlier article on Dunbar numbers are interesting reading.  I'm not sure whether the Dunbar number applies in all cases.

In some discussion on SNs recently, I theorised that if we analysed Social Networks that there would be people who maintained relationships in Groups, i.e meshes where everyone knows everyone.  Bridging between groups occurs because of multiple membership, i.e. person X knows all the parents in their kids soccer club, AND all the people at the office.  Dunbars number, and the theories around it, seem to apply here, i.e. to the social-grooming required in GROUPS. 

There would also be people who maintain relationships, between a lot of people who mostly do NOT know each other. We used to call these people Networkers, and typically they are the people you call when you want to know who to talk to about some topic where you have no personal connections.  I'm not sure whether the Dunbar number applies to those people's connections, probably the power-law applies better, i.e. they can maintain progressively more distant connections with progressively more people. 

Anecdotal, if you randomly pick people in for example Orkut then you'll see the same names turn up as intermediates in many cases. This is not necessarily because those people have large numbers of Orkut friends, but because their Orkut friends are dispersed over a range of sub-groups. 

I don't think that any of the SN tools do a good job of managing these kinds of relationships yet, in particular the lack of interworking between them causes problems as different Groups tend to belong to different SN systems, so the bridges are often not evident. Also the relative strength of a connection doesn't seem to drive the ranking of possible connections, i.e. I'm just as likely to be presented with a potential introduction through a person with a weak connection to the target, than through someone with a strong connection.

On tactic that comes to mind is the automated equivalent of an 18th/19th century butler, who mediated social interaction at a time when the intrusive, in-person visit was one of only two ways to make social contact. 

The butler has broad and nuanced knowledged of the circumstances in which the Lady is to be acknowledged to be IN.

Today's online presence indicators are flat; they tell everyone the same message; that one is working, or eating ice cream in front of the television. 

A butler would understand whether one is working or not, and would put through different connections at different hours.

A butler would understand the understand the nuances of one's social circle, and admit some people automatically, allowing others to wait, and requiring still others to leave a message.

We also need the 18th/19th century interface to the Butler, the calling card, which conveys by its printed message and accompanying whether the caller is a longlost relative whom the butler may not remember; a recommendation from a reputable source; a specific message about the urgency of the visit.

I think that the key to defeating the Dunbar number is to a) establish a real relationship to begin with and b) massage that relationship at least once per year.

I find that if I've built a meaningful relationship with someone, based on some shared experiences, simply getting in touch with someone once a year on their birthday is enough to keep the relationship alive.

You've got to distinguish between "friends" and everything else - the relationships that range across acquaintance, association, colleague and just plain "potentially useful." Why treat them all with the same UI? Why not invite your true friends to share a more intimate online relationship and keep the rest in the "relationship parking lot" of an Orkut? Yeah, I know that friends are often useful, too, but they deserve better than to share the same utilitarian role as that guy you met at SXSW last year.

I'll invite my real friends into my Grouper hangout, but I'm not a Congressional Rep, so I don't need to be responsible to hundreds of familiar names. I've got plenty of other things to do with my time, which I believe is the case with most of us.

Hi, Crhis. Three years' ago Adrian Scott asked this question too, and it led to his founding Ryze... 

from: http://www.edge.org/q2002/q_scott.html

Edge.org's Question Page of 2002 - by Adrian Scott. 
******

"How do we scale up the number of quality human relationships one person can sustain by many orders of magnitude? In an increasingly connected world, how does one person interact with a hundred thousand, a million or even a billion people?"

Our one fixed resource is time — human attention. As we become increasingly networked in the technological sense, we also become more networked in the social sense.

As our social networks scale up, we move more and more of our interactions to the technological sphere. We can have many more telephone interactions than we can have hand-written letter interactions. When we move from telephone to e mail, the number of interactions between people goes up even more dramatically.

Then we pair our e-mail interactions with a personal Web site, and we start moving our personalities into the technology net, as a way of automating and scaling up the number of relationships even further.

We end up with personal CRM systems to handle our increased interaction load, and then add interfaces from our technology net to our human forms. These interfaces will develop from current-day Palm Pilots and Blackberry's to heads-up display style interfaces in glasses and eventually retinal and neuronal interfaces.

"Hi Jerry, Ahh.., we met back in 1989, May 14th at 7pm, and since then we've exchanged 187 e-mails and 39 phone calls. I hope your cousin's daughter Gina had a wonderful graduation yesterday."

The whole range of interactions becomes organized. Introductions from one person to another, and rating systems become automated.

Currently many people run into barriers as their personal networks approach the range of thousands of people. Soon they will move to the tens of thousands, to the millions and beyond.

With these trends, the friction costs of personal introductions go down, and consequently the value of quality measurement and gatekeeping go up dramatically. As the depth of knowledge in a relationship increases, the threshold point at which you 'really know someone' increases also. It's an arms race of intimacy.

Adrian Scott is founder of Ryze, a business networking community. He is a founding investor in Napster, got his Ph.D. in nonlinear optimization at age 20, and has sung with Placido Domingo and performed with the NYC Ballet.

An Avatar? Maybe that's what I'm doing. I look at life as a whole. Coincidences (for lack of a non-cliched word) are road signs helping us determine a direction of movement (not necessarily in the physical realm).

I'm working on a software module which links coincidental interaction within Nature and published human consciousness. Currently I'm modeling Climate Change.

For my software to ultimately work within a social network, a persons daily life of data would be connected via an identifier - and freely available. Too, an aspect of human momentum would need to change dramatically - we would trust that life is a whole and not something to be mastered, assimilated, conquered. We would need to move to a much less mechanical decentralized world. And our user base would need to be decreased.

Which coincidentally, Climate Change is forcing upon us. And it's ramping up. 

Google, with all the tools I need (email, blog, webpages, and soon a social network site) seemed like a potential opportunity. They never responded to my email :)

My profile is lost within LinkedIn...

Learning by Subtraction

The human brain has on half the number of synapses at age six as it had at age two. It learns by subtraction. So do computer based neural nets. 

This principle could well be applied to organizations to increase the size of the Dunbar number that could work effectively without drowning in bureaucracy. 

Consider three ways to bring order in a human organization. The chain of command, community spirit and marketplace choice.

The chain of command tends to keep demanding ever more connections. You must get permission from all these people before taking action. The free intraprise systems we set up (See The Intelligent Organization by Gifford & Elizabeth Pinchot and link at the end of this post) allow people to connect and disconnect at the end of each contract at will. Teams contract with line officers and each other to get the work done, much like a virtual organization except that key competencies and trade secrets remain in the organization. 

Relationships that create value are maintained; those that consume value are terminated by either party. This provides a powerful advantage over the innane connections that are often maintained in highly time consuming ways in a bureaucracy. 

The force of community also has a self-organizing quality that allows people to volunteer for what has juice and walk away from relationships that consume purpose and meaning. Community is a necessary balance to free enterprise or free intraprise. Both should be used in place of the chain of command in many of the situations where the chain of command is used today.

Adina: Getting in touch once a year may keep a relationship alive, but only just. This begs the question, what do you want from your relationships? What do you value them for? What is the point in keeping a relationship on drip-feed attention when putting so little in precludes the possibility of growth, of enrichment, of greater intimacy, of learning something, of sharing the experience of life in some way.

Perhaps what we'll see, with or without the help of clever internet applications, is a polarisation: a small circle of close friends, a very wide circle of friendly acquaintances (whether social, professional, shared interest, discussion group, blog reader, etc, by origin), and an almost infinite range of potential one-off contacts. Along the lines Chris Reh is suggesting, I think.

I'm not sure I need to know which of my friendly acquaintances are in touch with one another. Better just to get on and live, and concentrate on putting something into those relationships, the better to get something out of them.

Or have I missed the point?

Fred, is there someone in your household who sends birthday cards and holiday cards? These are traditional tools for staying minimally in touch. They don't maintain intimacy, but they do keep an open door, so that it's easier to keep the benefits of weak ties, and regain contact when the time is right.

I just had a minor realization: when we speak of "dropping" someone from our personal network, are we really doing that? The fact is, they are very probably connected to other people we do know, and so what we are really doing is *delegating* the intimate relationship to someone we also know. Being able to see a map of my local network would help a lot in deciding whether to cut someone loose or not.

BODY:
<p>As a former Macintosh developer, I've always been disappointed with the user-interface of web pages. The state of the art of UI design moved backwards with the advent of the browser -- we traded connectivity for ease-of-use. With the advent of pages written in Flash, some better user-interfaces were created, but at the important cost of things like being able to copy text, have semantic and meta-data information imbedded in web pages, searchability, etc.</p>

<p>So I keep an eye out for innovative ideas that preserve the essence of what is so powerful about web pages, yet also offer a good ideas. My posts on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/10/map_mashup.html">Map Mashup</a> and <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/09/tiddlywiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a> offer some interesting web UI exemplars.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;complete=1"><img width="200" height="79" border="0" alt="Logo_google_suggest" title="Logo_google_suggest" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/logo_google_suggest.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>To this list of exemplars I now add <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&amp;complete=1">Google Suggest</a> by Google programmer <a href="http://www.google.com/googleblog/2004/12/ive-got-suggestion.html">Kevin Gibbs</a>, who wrote this as part of Google employee's ability to work 20% of the time on their own projects.

Google Suggest replaces the browser's default auto-complete with one specific to Google searching. As you type each letter of your search request, you are shown the most popular requests for that term, and how many search hits are available for that search term. You really have to try out to understand how amazing and intuitive it is.</p>

<p>Blogger <a href="http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/">Chris Justus</a> has <a href="http://serversideguy.blogspot.com/2004/12/google-suggest-dissected.html">dissected and documented</a> how Google Suggest works. If you are a web developer, I recommend you read his analysis and I hope it will inspire you.</p>

<p>This specific technique is probably not useful for all web sites -- the amount of load that even a small number of users can place on a database using this technique requires a large server infrastructure, as basically every time you type a letter a database is being hit. Google can do this as they understand server farms and how to scale large loads. However, as inspiration for other ideas, I think it is marvelous.</p>

<p>For instance, I didn't know you could take control over your browsers auto-complete functionality by setting autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; in your input field. Given this and the other techniques for display and cursor control, you could create dynamic auto-complete functionality on your own web pages, but skip the bandwidth intensive XMLHttpRequest by either caching the data in your web page, or in a user's cookie, or both. An example of this is <a href="http://blog.bitflux.ch/">BitFlux</a> blog's <a href="http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/livesearch_roundup.html">LiveSearch</a> functionality (which is also documented <a href="http://blog4.bitflux.ch/wiki/LiveSearch">here</a>).</p>

<p>The technique for retrieving the data using XMLHttpRequest is also marvelous. This functionality has been <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html">around for a while</a> but this is one of the cleanest examples of how to do it on the client side.</p>

<p>I've got some other ideas on how to apply some of these techniques to Wiki pages -- hopefully in the next few months I'll have some proof-of-concept examples for you to play around with.</p>

<p>In addition, Google Suggest is now, in a sense, a new web service from google that can be used independently. For instance Adam Stiles has <a href="http://www.adamstiles.com/adam/2004/12/hacking_google_.html">written</a> about a <a href="http://www.netcaptor.net/adsense/suggest.php">hack</a> to help suggest keywords for AdSense.</p>

Google Suggest is definitely interesting, and Kevin Gibbs is to be congratulated for putting it together. It's an elegant piece of work.

I think the most intersting things, though, aren't about the ability to use RPC calls from Javascript. This is pretty old stuff. Brent Ashley released the JSRS library (http://www.ashleyit.com/rs/main.htm) some years ago (cf. these two articles at IBM from 2001: http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-resc/?dwzone=web, http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-rich/). The technique is somewhat different, using a hidden Iframe as a buffer, but the effect is the same.

On the technical side, making this workable in real time is impressive. Rather than triggering actions with they onkeypress event, the input field is checked periodically with a timer. This means you don't have to wait from a response from google when you type something - if you get three letters entered in between checks, it will still appear nearly instant. (The above referenced article by Chris Justus may cover this, I can't recall at the moment). And the server side stuff required to be able to return search result counts so quickly has to be very well put together.

On the non-developer side, what I find intersting is that something that has been possible for over three years is hitting the mainstream because Google's done it. There are tremendous boosts in usability possible using RPC calls, but in my somewhere over six years of web consulting, usability has always been the hardest sell. Now that there's a high profile application of this technique, I expect it will become as popular as CNET's orange menu bar was. (If only they had put that on the right side...).

dwayne's exactly right - interest in Javascript RPC has increased exponentially since GMail and now Google Suggest.  I've seen hits to my remote scripting pages go crazy, with the side effect that my referrer spam has spiralled as well.

I first started building rich UIs with MS Remote Scripting in 1998, and I haven't done any development on JSRS for a couple of years now.  If I had the time or inclination to redo it now, I would definitely use XMLHTTP.  I had to use iframe/layer at the time for wide compatibility.

The image/cookie method is a great one for smaller stuff - I use ut to great effect at http://www.blogchat.com

You might appreciate my "Zuggest" tool.

It uses "Ajax" concepts and works similarly to Google Suggest but searches against the Amazon Product database as you're typing. 

Check it out: http://www.FrancisShanahan.com/zuggest.aspx

It's built with Javascript, Amazon Web Services, SOAP, XMLHttp, XML, C# and ASP.NET and SQL Server.

Would love to get some feedback on it.

This is another case where people are astonished to learn that there isn't any black magic going on here and that the functionality is there. it just takes quite a lot of fiddling to get right and in a form that is reusable. This is why I think that there is still a component market for these kinds of things. the google suggest and gmail suggest functionality has been commercialized already here:

<p>The term 'social software', which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush's ideas about 'memex' in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>

<p>By examining the many terms used to describe today's 'social software' we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how there exists a very real life cycle concerning the use of technical terminology.</p>

<h3>1940s — Memex</h3>

<p>The earliest reference that I can find to people using computers to collaborate with one another is from the 1940s.</p>

<p>Near the end of World War II, in 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote a seminal article on the future of computing in <a href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml">As We May Think</a>. In it, he conceived of a device he called the 'memex', which today we might call the personal computer:</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=497,height=312,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/memex.jpg"><img width="200" height="125" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/memex.jpg" title="Memex" alt="Memex" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a> </p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Later on, the article discusses Memex's further benefits to groups:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;And his trails do not fade. Several years later, his talk with a friend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations, even of vital interest. He has an example, in the fact that the outranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow. In fact he has a trail on it. A touch brings up the code book. Tapping a few keys projects the head of the trail. A lever runs through it at will, stopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions. It is an interesting trail, pertinent to the discussion. So he sets a reproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it to his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into the more general trail.</em></p>

<p><em>Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready-made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by its patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. The chemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all the chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails following the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical and chemical behavior.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is also the first mention in literature of what will eventually be called hypertext. However, the term 'memex' never caught on - - Vannevar's ideas were way before their time.</p>

<h3>1960's — ARPA and Licklider</h3>

<p><img width="160" height="242" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/licklider.jpg" title="J.C.R. Licklider" alt="J.C.R. Licklider" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></p>

<p>It wasn't until the early 1960s that I find the idea of using computers to collaborate came up again.</p>

<p>As a response to the USSR launching Sputnik, the US formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958. In l8 months, ARPA has developed the first successful satellite. In 1962 Dr. J.C.R. Licklider was appointed to head ARPA, and changed ARPA to offer more research grants to universities. In fact, it was due to his efforts that universities offered their first Ph.D.'s in computer science. It was this research that ultimately led to ARPANET, commercial time-sharing systems, and ultimately to the Internet.</p>

<p>Licklider wrote in 1968 in <a href="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/SRC/research- reports/SRC- 061.pdf#page=26">The Computer as a Communication Device</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;To appreciate the importance the new computer-aided communication can have, one must consider the dynamics of 'critical mass,' as it applies to cooperation in creative endeavor. Take any problem worthy of the name, and you find only a few people who can contribute effectively to its solution. Those people must be brought into close intellectual partnership so that their ideas can come into contact with one another. But bring these people together physically in one place to form a team, and you have trouble, for the most creative people are often not the best team players, and there are not enough top positions in a single organization to keep them all happy. Let them go their separate ways, and each creates his own empire, large or small, and devotes more time to the role of emperor than to the role of problem solver. The principals still get together at meetings. They still visit one another. But the time scale of their communication stretches out, and the correlations among mental models degenerate between meetings so that it may take a year to do a week’s communicating. There has to be some way of facilitating communication among people without bringing them together in one place.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Here you see Licklider really speaking of more than just communication. He also describes about methods of collaboration and how people function in groups.</p>

<h3>1960s — Augmentation</h3>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=410,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/doug_engelbart_collage.jpg"><img width="200" height="128" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/doug_engelbart_collage.jpg" title="Doug_engelbart_collage" alt="Doug_engelbart_collage" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>One of the early ARPA research projects was at SRI, where <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/englebart.html">Doug Englebart</a>, inspired by Vannevar Bush's vision, set up a research lab that created an elaborate hypermedia system called NLS (oNLine System). This was the first successful implementation of hypertext (though that term was not invented until later), and it was here that the mouse was invented as well as the first on-screen video teleconference.</p>

<p>Engelbart's seminal work was <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org/augdocs/friedewald030402/augmentinghumanintellect/ahi62index.html">Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework</a>, which he wrote in 1962. In it he set out his basic idea of augmentation:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;By 'augmenting human intellect' we mean increasing the capability of a man to approach a complex problem situation, to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs, and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more-rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble. And by 'complex situations' we include the professional problems of diplomats, executives, social scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, attorneys, designers—whether the problem situation exists for twenty minutes or twenty years. We do not speak of isolated clever tricks that help in particular situations. We refer to a way of life in an integrated domain where hunches, cut-and-try, intangibles, and the human 'feel for a situation' usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods, and high-powered electronic aids.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>He was also among the first to say that in order to design such tools, we must:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;integrate psychology and organizational development with all of these advances in computing technology.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Over time this term evolved to become called 'office augmentation' -- Englebart preferred the term 'augmentation' over almost anywhere that 'automation' was used, as automation seem de-personalizing. However, Englebart's work was ultimately sold by SRI to Tymshare, where they commercialized it under their newly formed &quot;Office Automation Division&quot;. Thus it appears that term 'automation' won over the term 'augmentation', and Englebart's ideas of integrating psychology and organization development were lost.</p>

<h3>1970s — Office Automation</h3>

<p>IBM coined the term 'word processing' in the 1960s, which originally encompassed all business equipment -- including manually operated typewriters -- that was concerned with the handling of text, as opposed to data. By the 70s they were attempting to broaden the scope of their products to all aspects of the office, so they coined the term 'office automation'.</p>

<p>The use of this term swiftly become quite generic, and was used by all the major computer companies of the time. However, any ideas of collaboration become lost in the ideas of process and automation.</p>

<h3><a name="EIES"></a>1970s — Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES)</h3>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=269,height=342,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/planet_ti_eies.gif"><img width="200" height="254" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/planet_ti_eies.gif" title="Planet_ti_eies" alt="Planet_ti_eies" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>Yet the number of successful product lines bearing the tag 'office automation' did mean that there was increased research money for creating new tools. One of the most important was a project called <a href="http://www.wikiworld.com/wiki/index.php/EIES%20Legacy">Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES)</a>, which had funding from for-profit companies like IBM and AT&amp;T, non-profit foundations like the Annenberg Trust, and governmental agencies like NSF and the New Jersey Commission of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>EIES was the first major implementation of collaborative software. In a <a href="http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/Papers/DelphiConference.pdf">paper</a> from 1972, EIES founder <a href="http://eies.njit.edu/~turoff/">Murray Turoff</a> describes an early version of EIES:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;Basically the Delphi Conference appears to have utility when one or more of the following conditions were met:</em></p><blockquote>

<li><em> the group cannot meet often enough in committee to give adequate timely consideration to the topic because of time or distance constraints</em></li>

<li><em> there is a specific reason to preserve the anonymity of the conferees (e.g., refereeing of position papers or a free exchange among different levels in an organizational structure)</em></li>

<li><em> the group is too large for an effective conference telephone call or committee exchange</em></li>

<li><em> the group is interdisciplinary to the extent that a structured or refereed communication mode as opposed to a committee or panel approach is more desirable in promoting an efficient exchange of information</em></li>

<li><em> telephone and letter communications, on a one-to-one basis, are insufficient or too cumbersome to augment the particular committee activity</em></li>

<li><em> disagreement among members of the group are too severe for a meaningful committee of face-to-face process for the exchange of views and information. </em></li></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>You can see from this list that EIES pioneered many of the concepts of BBS- style community software that we see today. Ultimately EIES featured threaded-replies, anonymous messages, polling, etc. Also, note the early importance of trying to understand groups so that you can optimize for the best group process.</p>

<p>However, as a generic term, EIES was too cumbersome. I see references from that period to terms like 'decision support system', 'computer-mediated communications', and 'collective intelligence', but none of these were broadly adopted either.</p>

<h3>1980s — Groupware (Part 1)</h3>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ptjl.jpg" title="Ptjl" alt="Ptjl" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.awakentech.com/at/Awaken.nsf/d4cbbb795713bdee882564640074729d/8d2c4ffefd30d8b7882564650009851a!OpenDocument">Peter and Trudy Johnson-Lenz</a> are credited by many as coining the term 'groupware' in <a href="http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC23/JnsnLenz.htm">1978</a>, after experiencing EIES for the first time. They defined groupware as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;intentional group processes plus software to support them.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I have long preferred this definition for two reasons -- first, the word intentional implies conscious design. Second, this definition also contains the important distinction that group processes come before the software. I felt that this definition properly excluded multi-user databases and electronic mail that are not designed specifically to enhance the group process. (I wrote about this in an 1990 article called <a href="http://www.alacritymanagement.com/DoG.html">Definitions of Groupware</a>.)</p>

<p>There were a number of other definitions during that period:</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <li><a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/englebart.html">Doug Engelbart</a> — <em>&quot;A co-evolving human-tool system.&quot;</em></li>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <li><a href="http://www.collaborate.com/about/about_david_coleman.html">David Coleman</a> — <em>&quot;Computer-mediated collaboration that increases the productivity or functionality of person-to-person processes.&quot;</em></li>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <li><a href="http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~skip/Home.html">C.A. 'Skip' Ellis</a> - - <em>&quot;Computer-based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment.&quot;</em></li>
</blockquote>

<p>Very swiftly, the term 'groupware' was adopted by the EIES community, as well as many of the spinoff software that was developed in the early 80's. However, the term was not broadly adopted outside of this community for some time.</p>

<h3>1980s — Computer-Supported Collaborative (or sometimes Cooperative) Work (CSCW)</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, the academic community was not happy with either the term 'office automation' or 'groupware' for research into how groups use computers to collaborate.</p>

<p>After the failure of an ACM conference on Office Automation, MIT's <a href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/greif.html">Irene Greif</a> and DEC's Paul Cashman coined the term CSCW for a workshop held in 1984, which was followed by the first CSCW conference in 1986. There is still an annual <a href="http://www.acm.org/cscw2004/index.html">CSCW Conference</a>, which this year is being held in Chicago on November 6-10th.</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=600,height=400,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/cc.gif"><img width="200" height="133" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/cc.gif" title="Cc" alt="Cc" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>The people initially involved with this conference came from either Human Computer Interaction (HCI) background or Information Systems (IS) background, thus the different definitions for the second 'C' in 'CSCW'; the HCI people preferred the small team focused 'cooperative', whereas the IS people chose the broader 'collaborative'. <a href="http://www.msu.edu/~schopie1/talk_rosewood_03-04-16.html">Scott Schopieray</a> has a nice diagram about this on the right.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dml.cs.ucf.edu/cybrary/fyi_cscw.html">Digital Media Laboratory</a> defines CSCW as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;a multidisciplinary research field including computer science, economics, sociology, and psychology. CSCW research focuses on developing new theories and technologies for coordination of groups of people who work together.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod/dblp/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wilson:Brian.html">Brian Wilson</a> defined it as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;CSCW is a generic term which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, software, services and techniques.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>However, most definitions I've seen compare it to groupware:</p>

<blockquote>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <li><a href="http://www.telekooperation.de/cscw/cscw.html">Applied Informatics and Distributed Systems Group at Technische Universitat Munchen</a> — <em>&quot;While Groupware refers to the real computer-based systems, the notion CSCW means the study of tools and techniques of Groupware as well as their psychological, social and organizational effects.&quot;</em></li>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <li><a href="http://www.infres.enst.fr/~vercken/multicast/cscw.html">Tom Brink</a> — <em>&quot;Groupware is often used to specifically denote the technology that people use to work together, whereas CSCW refers to the field that studies the use of that technology.&quot;</em></li>
</blockquote>

<p>This term never really was adopted by anyone except the academic community, and even now, there are many that prefer different terms, such as 'social computing' or 'coordination science'. <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">danah boyd</a> offered this comment to me in an email:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;In the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) space (those who address this area in academia), one switch has been to 'social computing' and the move was far more intentional. CSCW comes out of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) paradigm.&nbsp; By and large, HCI has been strongly associated with quantitative psychology in terms of methods.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Groupware and collaborative software have a heavy handed connotation of 'work' (deeply connected to HCI's emphasis on activity theory).&nbsp; While CSCW has the term work directly embedded in it, there's a strong push towards other aspects of social life.&nbsp; Qualitative approaches have been infused into HCI and HCI practitioners are drawing heavily from sociology and anthropology, focusing directly on everyday social life. [This move may also be a purposeful move towards Marx, but maybe i'm reading too far into things.]&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>1990's — Groupware (Part 2)</h3>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=558,height=437,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/grove_groupware.gif"><img width="200" height="156" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/grove_groupware.gif" title="Grove_groupware" alt="Grove_groupware" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the term 'groupware' hit the mainstream in 1988, when Robert Johansen wrote the best-selling business book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0029164915/skotos-20/104-8061732- 6194323">Groupware: Computer Support for Business Teams</a>. One unique contribution that Johansen's book offered was a distinction between time and place for different types of collaboration. See the diagram on the right for some detail.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was this success that was also the downfall of the term 'groupware', for it got co-opted by marketing. Initially the co-opting was done by Lotus Notes, which I personally didn't feel deserved to be called groupware, as it was really more of a multi-user database that could be used to make groupware, but wasn't actually groupware. Then Microsoft further corrupted the term when they released Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook with calendaring features to compete with Lotus Notes, and called that groupware as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fudco.com/chip/">Chip Morningstar</a>, an early pioneer in collaboration software and virtual worlds, comments:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;(in the 1990's) I know that we (the Xanadu/AMIX community) hated the term 'groupware', as would anyone who has any respect for the English language. Also, at the time, the term was generally applied to things like Lotus Notes, which we felt was in a category distinct from what we were doing.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Currently Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupware">defines groupware</a> as:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;software that integrates work on a single project by several concurrent users at separated workstations&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus today almost any software that supports multiple users can somewhat legitimately say that they are 'groupware'.</p>

<h3>1990s — Origin of Social Software</h3>

<p>While the term 'groupware' was slowly losing its meaning, a new phrase, 'social software' was beginning to coming into vogue. However, for the first 15 years of its existence, mostly in the 1990s, the term was rarely used outside of very specialized groups.</p>

<p>One of the best ways I've found to see how words, terms, phrases, and memes spread through culture is looking through Google's marvelous archive of usenet newsgroups. Searching by date, the earliest reference I can find to the term 'social software' is a posting in <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22social+software%22&amp;start=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr =&amp;ie=UTF- 8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;scoring=d&amp;selm=Aug.9.00.45.25.1990.28902%40athos.rutgers.edu &amp;rnum=101">1990</a> -- in this newsgroup posting it isn't really clear what the definition of social software is, only that it is associated with 'open hypertext' and a committee in Japan to study 'social-hyper computing'. The next mention of social software is in <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22social+software%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF- 8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;scoring=d&amp;selm=Feb.12.22.44.50.1992.14723%40planchet.rutgers.edu&amp;rnum=100">1992</a> in which Ted Nelson's Xanadu and Phil Salin's AMIX are called social software.</p>

<p>The next couple of years of usage of the term social software appear to be largely associated with the nanotechnology community and those influenced by them, or by the diaspora of people who left Xanadu and AMIX when they were both closed by Autodesk. Given these references, my first guess was that the term originated within Xanadu/AMIX communities, as they had close connections with many of the people involved with nanotechnology.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/drexler.jpg" title="K. Eric Drexler" alt="K. Eric Drexler" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /> </p>

<p>However, after contacting some of my collegues that used to work for Xanadu or AMIX, they say the term probably came from K. Eric Drexler, founder of the <a href="http://www.foresight.org/">Foresight Institute</a>. Drexler is best known for coining the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, and his interest in hypertext and group augmentation comes from his desire to make sure that we think critically about the technology before we develop it.</p>

<p>The earliest reference that I can find to term 'social software' in his writings is in <a href="http://www.islandone.org/Foresight/WebEnhance/HPEK1.html">Hypertext Publishing and the Evolution of Knowledge</a>, originally published at the Hypertext '87 Conference, but updated online though 1997), where the term is used three times, in the following contexts:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>KINDS OF HYPERTEXT<br />...<br /><strong>Filtered vs. bare hypertext:</strong> A system that shows users all local links (no matter how numerous or irrelevant) is bare hypertext. A system that enables users to automatically display some links and hide others (based on user-selected criteria) is filtered hypertext. This implies support for what may be termed <strong>social software</strong>, including voting and evaluation schemes that provide criteria for later filtering.<br />...<br />AGENT LEVELS<br />...<br />Agents can also implement social software functions - for example, applying voting-and-rating algorithms to sets of reader evaluations and publishing the results.<br />...<br />IMPROVING PROBLEM SOLVING<br />...<br />A hypertext publishing medium will have abilities beyond supporting improved critical discussion. Since it is computer-based, it can naturally support software for collaborative development of modeling games and simulations [29] (and enable effective criticism of published model structures and parameters). Social software could facilitate group commitment and action: individuals could take unpublicized positions of the form I will publicly commit to X if Y other people do so at the same time. Once Y people take a compatible position, everyone's commitment (to making a statement, forming a group, making a contribution, etc.) could be automatically published. The possibilities for hypertext-based social software seem broad.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I wrote Eric to find out why he used the term, and this was his reply:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;I don't recall when I began using it (it wasn't in Engines of Creation), but it does seem to me, as best I can recall, that I coined it.</em></p>

<p><em>I used the term 'social software' because I am concerned with communication and collaboration on all scales, including the whole of society. Thus, I see media at the scale of the World Wide Web as forms of social software.</em></p>

<p><em>We need to make society-scale conflict -- not just group-scale cooperation -- more productive. Better media, better social software, can help.</em></p>

<p><em>I'd rather see an emphasis on this dimension of social software than on the origin of the name itself.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Drexler's term 'social software' didn't initially take off. There do not appear to be many consistent mentions of the term in the late 90's. There continue to be references that I attribute to the term spreading out from the nanotechnology community, but also I see references to the 'social software' of the brain. There also seem to be a few consulting companies named Social Software but none appear to have had much success. Wiki was invented in 1995, but I don't see it, or any of the subsequent wikis defining themselves as social software for a number of years.</p>

<h3>2000s — Evolution of Social Software</h3>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/clayshirky.jpg" title="Clayshirky" alt="Clayshirky" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></p>

<p>It isn't until late 2002 that the term 'social software' came into more common usage, probably due to the efforts of <a href="http://www.shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a> who organized a &quot;Social Software Summit&quot; in November of 2002. He recalls his first usage of the term to be from approximately April of 2002.</p>

<p>I asked Clay if it was the loss of meaning in the terms 'groupware' that made him choose the term 'social software', and he replied:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;I was looking for something that gathered together all uses of software that supported interacting groups, <strong>even if the interaction was offline</strong>, e.g. Meetup, nTag, etc. Groupware was the obvious choice, but had become horribly polluted by enterprise groupware work.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I asked him why he didn't use the term 'collaborative software' and he commented:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;...because that seems a sub-set of groupware, leaving out other kinds of group processes such as discussion, mutual advice or favors, and play.</em></p>

<p><em>The broader issue is that there was no word or phrase that grouped the CSCW and online community currents together without also including a lot of non-group oriented stuff. CMC (Computer-Mediated Communication) for example, includes broadcast outlets like C|Net, two-person email exchanges, and spam -- much too broad. There was also no word or phrase that called attention to the explosion of interesting software for group activities that fell outside online communities and CSCW, things like Bass-Station (which is for offline community) or &quot;Uncle Roy is All Around You&quot; (which is computer-supported collaborative play.)&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Clay also offered me some interesting commentary on the term 'social computing':</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;On a side note, there is in the research community a similar phrase, 'social computing', that both MSFT and IBM use. I think this phrase also doesn't fit the domain well. It seems to suffer from Shannon Envy, where the researchers interested in social effects are trying to convince their colleagues that what they are working on is also computing.</em></p>

<p><em>I think the 'social computing' phrase is a shame for two reasons. First, there's no need to apologize for studying social effects by pretending that they are a form of computing (the old argument about computers as computing vs communicating devices goes back to Licklider in the early 60s, and its disheartening to see the communications people agonizing over it 40 years on).</em></p>

<p><em>Second, the phrase social computing could describe a really interesting domain, where groups are used to find approximately optimal solutions to hard combinatorial problems.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>2000s — Changing Definitions of Social Software</h3>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=579,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/ryzeblogtribefriends.gif"><img width="200" height="181" border="0" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/ryzeblogtribefriends.gif" title="Ryzeblogtribefriends" alt="Ryzeblogtribefriends" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a></p>

<p>An early definition by Clay for the definition of social software was:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;1. Social software treats triads of people differently than pairs.<br /> 2. Social software treats groups as first-class objects in the system.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>However, Clay more recently prefers the simpler:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;software that supports group interaction&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I note that this is quite a bit closer to the Johnson-Lenz definition of groupware.</p>

<p>One of areas of disagreement about the definition of social software is one of scope. <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SunirShah">Sunir Shah</a> host of <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki">MeatballWiki</a> conceives of social software as being mainly about support for online communities, whereas Clay Shirky desires for it to also:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;explicitly try to include online support for both lightweight social value (e.g. del.icio.us) and offline interaction (e.g. Dodgeball, PacManhattan) in the definition.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>There is a long discussion on Meatball Wiki at <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SocialSoftware">SocialSoftware</a> on this topic. One of the more interesting definitions comes from <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2002/12/on_the_augmentation_of_human_social_networking_abilities.shtml">Tom Coates</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;augmentation of human's socializing and networking abilities by software, complete with ways of compensating for the overloads this might engender&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I asked <a href="http://alevin.com/weblog/">Adina Levin</a>, of <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a>, about her thoughts on why we are now using the term 'social software' and not some other term. She said:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>&quot;I believe that there are new things in social software, but we're also compelled to use new words instead of building on the old ones because of the way the discourse works.</em></p>

<p><em>When you talk about 'groupware', people think of the hard-to-use, under-adopted Lotus Notes category. In the mid-90s, groupware and knowledge management were used for software that represented the taylorization of knowledge work – the idea that you can automate knowledge work into pre-defined workflows and &quot;capture the assets&quot; in people's brains. Often, the ideas sound good to managers, but the tools did little for the people using them. There were fancy schemes intended to &quot;incent participation&quot; because the tools didn't do much for the people using them without lollipops. Email had massive adoption, and more complex tools often gathered dust.</em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, the term 'virtual community' became associated with discredited ideas about cyberspace as an independent polity, and failed dotcom ideas about assembling community in the shadow of a mass-market brand such as forums on the Coca Cola site. 

</em></p>

<p><em>Several years ago, in the depths of the tech recession, there were signs of creative life in weblog and journal communities, conversation discovery with daypop and then technorati, the growth curve of wikipedia, mobile games, photo and playlist sharing. The liveliness was about the communities, and also about the culture of tool mix'n'match <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define+bricolage">bricolage</a>. Many of the attributes of social software -– hyperlinks for naming and reference, weblog conversation discovery, standards-based aggregation -– build on older forms. But the difference in scale, standardization, simplicity, and social incentives provided by web access turn a difference in degree to a difference in kind.</em></p>

<p><em>These forms grew without any forced discussion &quot;how to incent participation&quot;. People are compelled to write blogs and journals to show off and to share, to contribute to wikipedia and open source software projects for the joy of building things with other people. There are some lessons about social patterns and social affordances that this generation of social software communities and tools get right, are worth understanding and building on.</em></p>

<p><em>We might be better off as a culture if we used rhetorical techniques from traditional cultures to appropriate the words of the previous generation, but deepen them with new insights from the current generation. But we're children of the enlightenment, we want progress, and in order to get the (deserved) attention for new generations of real innovation, we need to use new terms.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>2010 — Future Thoughts on Social Software</h3>

<p><img border="0" src="http://lifewithalacrity.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/vrconf.jpg" title="VR Conference" alt="VR Conference" class="image-full" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" />

</p>

<p>In examining the origins of 'social software' we can see the terminology for the field has moved through a sort of life cycle. There have been many terms for this type of software, some of which have taken off, and some of which have not.</p>

<p>Typically, a visionary originates a term, and a community around that visionary may (or may not) adopt it. The diaspora of the term from that point can be slow, with 10 or 15 years passing before a term is more generally adopted. Once a term is more broadly adopted, it faces the risk of becoming a marketing term, corrupted into differentiating products rather than explaining ideas.</p>

<p>Is 'social software', which just now gaining wide acceptance, destined for the same trash heap of uselessness as groupware? And, if so, what impact does the changing of this terminology have on the field of social software itself? Only the future holds those answers ...</p>

-----
EXTENDED BODY:

-----
EXCERPT:
<p>The term 'social software', which is now used to define software that supports group interaction, has only become relatively popular within the last two or more years. However, the core ideas of social software itself enjoy a much longer history, running back to Vannevar Bush's ideas about 'memex' in 1945, and traveling through terms such as Augmentation, Groupware, and CSCW in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.</p>

<p>By examining the many terms used to describe today's 'social software' we can also explore the origins of social software itself, and see how a very real life cycle centers around the use of technical terminology.</p>
<p>[Post continues with an exploration of a history of terms associated with collaborative software]</p>

I made it explicit what I thought the definition should be on the page, which was not at all limited to online communities. I wrote, "software that humans create to ease contacting each other." 

I could simplify that by "software that facilitates communication."

But I also said that I do not find any meaning in this term. While it's true that software can create value for communication, I don't think the software just isn't the driving force. People will warm over the flaws of the worst software to communicate with each other if there is a compelling community. Just look at LiveJournal or even GREX. But there is no such thing as compelling enough software that will cause people to start using it if there is no one on the other end. Even the most wonderful phone system would be useless if you could only get a dialtone but no warm bodies.

Rather, the artifacts of the software are informed by desires and values and communities that motivate the creation of that software. Spending too much time looking at the software is like trying to analyze a herd migration by the footprints. While no doubt informative, they aren't as predictive as looking at the elephants stampeding on the plane. Or quite as majestic.

I agree with Sunir that this term has little meaning; it is an air tent. When people stop blowing into it, it will collapse.

The main problem is that it seems to direct attention (as the previous term, groupware, also did) to social process and predesigned 'collaborative' activities. No one in his right mind would wish to discuss telephones in so overblown a manner. We pick one up (flip one open) and make a call. Everything starts from the gesture of an individual and it is a gesture outward that immediately invokes and involves another individual. What happens *from there forward* is indeed social, but the tools have nothing to do with it.

For better or worse, a term like 'memex' (or one like 'spreadsheet' for that matter) tries to describe an object, a tool. This term, social software, leads directly away from understanding the tool it purports to describe.

I might add, btw, and in disagreement with Clay, that the term "social computing" is in fact a useful term -- it is useful in just the ways that terms like "personal computing" and the term of the mini-computer era, "departmental computing", were useful.

You might expect me to hold this view, of course: see my site http://www.socialcomputing.org

You might be overlooking some significant milestones in the mid-to-late 90s, especially in the areas of Social Networks, SNA, communities of practice, Knowledge Management, and the "six degrees" folks. In particular, pioneers like Rob Cross (SNA, communities of practice),Larry Prusak (KM, communities of practice), Rob Usey (KnowledgeX, relationship mining) and others really drove many of the basic concepts and practices that these people, in the early 2000s, built upon.

One interesting fact is that "groupware" software is often called a "groupware suite" which actually emplies that it is a bundle of related software tools which enable and enhance productivity among and within groups.

How could you overlook 25+ years of computer bulletin board software? You, or someone, clearly knew it existed, quoting your own article, "... that EIES pioneered many of the concepts of BBS- style community software that we see today."

BBS systems were in use world-wide by the mid-1980's, with hundreds of thousands of users, very many of them non-technical.

Why this particular omission?

Enjoyed your article but it occurred to me, aren't financial markets also a much older example of social computing? For that matter, elections too. Perhaps any group decision making throughout history is fit for your discussion, regardless of the computation method and algorithm used to process? I would agree that technologies have influenced outcomes however, but where you draw the semantic lines isn't clear to me..."computing" can be done by an abacus, a scorecard, a machine, an intelligent agent, and the communications element necessary for it to be "social" has many iterations throughout history as well...

Actually, from what I've been able to determine, most of the ideas behind all BBS software today derive ultimately from Ward Christianson's first CBBS in 1975, who turn derived most of his ideas from being exposed to EIES on ARPANET at the time.

I do believe that that the history of the BBS is very important to the history of the why and how community software exists the way it does today. However, in this article I was trying to more excusively limit myself to people who were more thinking about group process very early on.

The Memex was more than a dream. It was part of a thriving tradition of information organisation that predated computing, and more importantly, was all but constructed. So to view it as a "first mention" does it a disservice. I quote myself from another site (http://www.digibarn.com/stories/desktop-history/bushytree.html) (recycling!) which has a history of HCI:

=============================
Vannevar Bush was already famous as a designer of analog computers, and also an expert in the field of micrographics. He was already aware of the automated electronic information retrieval/control systems in use at places like MIT. Their origins lay in Europe with the coterie gathered around Paul Otlet, and they had a fully functional hypertext system with iconic access in 1912. Despite the War and the Depression, the march of both micrography and automated retrieval proceeded apace, and Bush was involved with their use in documentation during the war. The problem was not with rapid recall - that was well established. It was with the recording side of things. Micrographing and encoding took some time, and a significant part of what he envisaged in the Memex was the instantaneous storage mechanism he hoped would arrive. The significant thing that seems to bypass most histories is the fact that Bush had already built this type of machine at MIT, and perhaps more significantly co-operated with Kodak and NCR to work on the mechanisms that derived in part from his differential analyzer (the Comparator and the Microfilm Rapid Selector). 

As We May Think was actually written in 1939, in secrecy as a Govt report. The Library of Congress and Kodak were very busy with micrographic information retrieval. (One of the best sources on this technology is Jolley's Data Study from the early 60s. It shows how all of this worked, and worked well). And last but not least there is another connection wth Europe in the form of Emanuel Goldberg of Zeiss Ikon, who had developed the first significant opto-electronical retrieval system for documentation in the 1920s. (it was Goldberg's work that stopped Bush's patent application). Goldberg went around the world showing his machine in the middle 1930s, even got kidnapped by Nazi spies (!). It is difficult to know how much of the Work of Otlet, Goldberg and friends influenced the ideas of the MEMEX, but it alters the idea of the lonely visionary and puts this into scope.

==================
The Digibarn exhibit on the Bushy Tree is an important resource for this research and is well worth a read for the purposes of investigating social software. 
Perhaps a bushy tree is needed for your page?

The timeline misses Jacques Vallee (http://www.jacquesvallee.com/), who is a direct disciple of Engelbart (in 1971) but who went on the the Institute for the Future (IFTF) and wrote FORUM, an early BBS software. FORUM was the direct inspiration for the development in Sweden of KOM, another BBS system that ran on DEC PDP-10 systems, which was used from dial-in terminals throughout the 1980s.

Also, the development of the Michigan Terminal System (MTS) at the University of Michigan in the 1960s had important implication on the development of early online communities in the u.s. mid west. The online conferencing system Confer went into production in 1975.

A topic that I think should be included is the role of PLATO, as described in David Wooley's paper here http://www.thinkofit.com/plato/dwplato.htm .  PLATO Notes was developed in 1973, not long after EIES, and it is significant for two reasons.  First, it very quickly became an important part of an ongoing production environment, evolving new features and (unexpectedly) creating an on-line community that flourished for many years.  Secondly, a close examination of the list of "PLATO People" at http://www.platopeople.com/people.html clearly shows that a lot of very influential people in the computer industry were themselves influenced by PLATO, and it is indeed fair to say that many of the systems that truly popularized this technology were direct descendants of PLATO Notes, built by people who had used PLATO Notes.  Three of the four founders of Iris Accociates (the company that build Lotus Notes) were PLATO users, and one of the three had previously written VAX Notes (which was widely used within DEC in the early 80s), and several of the developers of early Usenet tools were also PLATO veterans.  That article linked above lists many more descendants of PLATO Notes.

Thanks Rich for mentioning PLATO.   I was just about to but am glad to see someone beat me to it.  (I'm the person who runs the PLATOPeople.com website, and am writing a book about the history and significance of the PLATO system, particularly as it pertains to all things "social software").

No understanding of the history of social software is complete without a full appreciation of the PLATO phenomenon.

Very useful review, Christopher. I think one of the main sources of confusion with respect to terminology is that the focus is on trying to marry concepts like group, social, and collaboration to _technology_ instead of to _systems_. To deal with this, we should start thinking in _socio-technical systems_ instead of technologies in isolation. See my "Social Software: What's in a Name?" post:

The "Social Software of Accounting and Information Systems" book concentrates on how accounting information systems influence and are influenced by human interaction and organization culture. I think it explores a different notion of social software. A software that is embedded in a social group and thus affects its (the group's) behaviour. 
The "modern concept" is about facilitating social interaction, intentionally.

Social software is "software for societies". It's purpose is to lubricate and to help the formation of social groups and social relationships.

Social software recognizes that people are complex and interactions need to allow people to express their full richness as a person, or a human being. Groupware focuses on processes, roles and permissions.

Here are two example commentaries, guess which one is social software, and which one is groupware.

a) Further information required: Are we dealing with a problem of customer perception or is this a software issue?

b) That was a pretty cool feature for the techno-freaks here (hi Mark!). The real problem with the Rollestone account is that the technical manager got rolled over management about the choice of software and he is pretty annoyed about having to deal with us. We should get Peter from accounts management to smooth up the relationship.

Social software is the equivalent of the water cooler, where the full character of the participants are revealed and facilitated, and fosters better social relationships, in such a way that the group becomes healthier and more robust.

Great article, Some peoples comments questioned Social Software use as a term....

ie from Tom "What happens *from there forward* is indeed social, but the tools have nothing to do with it....For better or worse, a term like 'memex' (or one like 'spreadsheet' for that matter) tries to describe an object, a tool. This term, social software, leads directly away from understanding the tool it purports to describe. 

I couldnt disagree more - Why should we be forced to only think of tools purely in their most functional form, rather than to wisely see them in their higher order effects, the effects that really matter. Social Software is a great term, because it makes us realize that the importance of these tools is not just in the immediate funtions (eg  easier personal publishing, or lubricating a group conversation) but also in the many higher order effects that emerge downstream from the cross interactions, feedback loops, reinforcement, and new holopticism that becomes. Being unable to see Social Software as more than its components parts is taking a reductionistic approach. Moving forward we need to see the greater whole that is now emerging from the new "Social Softwares" available to us. Social Softwares as an ecology made up of things such as RSS, blogs with trackbacks, the technorati's and other social analysis tools are now giving us new eyes to see our own collective intelligence, they are massively re-connecting us and giving birth to increasing levels of shared social experience & conciousness. 

Going back to Toms issue, he feels the term Social software doesnt describe the tool, that the tools have nothing to do with socialization. Well I believe that they are absolutely about that, they allow us to take our socialization, group forming, group collaboration, and will eventually help us reach toward a new collective intelligence, that we simply cannot achive without them. They are absolutely "Social" tools. Just as the "Market" is a holopticism for financial people,  del.ici.us & technorati are effectively holopticisms for groupthink on topics &  classifications.

I would like to thank those that put this website together for its accuracy and for a website I can direct all my students to in order to get an overview of the history of this concept.

A slightly different perspective I have had from the time we designed EIES and experienced what happened on it and later the WELL is that any systems that allows either direct or indirect communications between the users is a social systems.  Students in HCI and the Design of Information Systems have to be aware of the fact that they are deigning a social system.  The have to realize that this will bring about a negotiation process between the users and the system that creates changes to the existing system.  That the design of such systems can impact on the form of the resulting social system.  The most recent example emerging is the virtual stock markets that allow thousands of people to compare their views about just about anything like movies or presidential candidates.  In my jargon, it is just another scaling method to try and provide everyone a collective feedback of what the group judgment is, as does the Delphi process.  Recently I have been very much involved in using computer based Delphi process as Learning Systems to help groups deal with very complex problems.  The original 1973 Delphi Method book is now free on my website and has many examples of paper and pencil group communication designs.  It also has a little philosophy about it as well.  It also has some insight on early Computer Medidated Communication efforts.

1960s:  Copiers (Xerox) allow mid-casting of
        documents.

1970s   E-Mail starts to proliferate

1980's  Local Printers start to replace copiers
        as Mid-Casting devices

1990s   Groupware such as Lotus Notes
        Instant Messaging
        Cell Phone Text Messaging

In a way, any sort of computer-mediated communication can be called social software since communication is inherently social, e.g. any sort of groupware educational web-services like LMSs, virtual environments. However, we prefer a more narrow definition of social software that includes applications that add an "extra touch" in the spirit of what some interpret as "web 2.0".
Social computing can be described in terms of social software types, for example:
(1)Social syndication of contents and links
(2)Social networking (professional, dating)

BODY:
<p><a href="http://www.jotspot.com/about/index.php">Joe Kraus</a>, one of the co-founders of Excite, and new <a href="http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/">blogger</a> has long been <a href="http://owt.typepad.com/blog/2004/09/wiki_and_then_s.html">rumored</a> to be working on a new wiki tool. Today at the <a href="http://www.web2con.com/pub/w/32/program.html">Web 2.0</a> conference Joe finally unveiled <a href="http://www.jotspot.com">JotSpot</a>, a new type of wiki that they have named an "Application Wiki". JotSpot appears to be not only an advanced wiki, but it also moves the predominantly text-based wiki toward being able to handle structured data and web application development.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.jotspot.com/tours/advanced/img/slide09.jpg"border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" >At the JotSpot website there is an page on <a href="http://jot.com/compare/index.php">How JotSpot is Different</a> and an <a href="http://jot.com/tours/advanced/1.php">Advanced Tour</a> of this wiki's database capabilities.</p>

<p>Better, however, is a demonstration that Joe Kraus and Graham Spencer gave InfoWorld reporter <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/06.html#a1090">Jon Udell</a> an early <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/jot.swf">demo of JotSpot</a>, which Jon screen-captured and has released as a 23-minute, 32MB Flash presentation. This demo is very impressive: in addition to incremental improvements to wiki, such as WYSIWYG editing, email support, indexed attachments, RSS and web page importing, etc.  Kraus and Spencer also demonstrate a very powerful forms templating interface that is very much like creating HTML forms with Javascript, and demonstrated integration with a <a href="http://www.salesforce.com">SalesForce.com</a> web application using SOAP. It appears that JotSpot leverages the unstructured and adhoc advantages that are a strength of wiki, yet allows structure to be added later such that the data in the wiki can be integrated with other non-wiki applications.</p>

<p>The discussion during the demo is also very interesting. Jon Udell made an observation about JotSpot entering into Lotus Notes territory, and Kraus and Spencer discuss how JotSpot makes web application development more accessible, and expressed their desire to create a marketplace for small developers to create tools using JotSpot.</p>

<p>From what I've seen so far, JotSpot looks like it may the first of a third-generation of wikis, the first being the very simple wikis such as <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WardCunningham">Ward Cunningham's</a> <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">C2 Wiki</a>, and second generation being database-backed wikis such as <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a> and <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a>. If you are serious about wiki, I highly recommend you take a look at this demo.</p>

<p>Joe Kraus also announced today that they have received a $5.2M funding round from <a href="http://www.redpoint.com">Redpoint</a> and <a href="http://mayfield.com">Mayfield</a>, both top VC firms.</p>

Hi,

If you like the notion of Application Wikis, you should have a look at the open source project XWiki.. It includes not only a form engine but also a programming API inside wiki pages as well as un underlying relational database..

Thanks for the wriet up Christopher. I think you asked for a beta. We're trying to provision accounts as rapidly as we can (while making sure that things are scaling ok). I should be able to guarantee you get provisioned in the next 2-3 days. If there any questions I can answer, don't hesitate to ask.

<p>MultiMap is a company that sells maps and aerial photos, primarily for Great Britain. They offer an online map tool that is very similar to that used by MapQuest or Yahoo Maps.</p>

<p>However, for certain regions, they have this fabulous capability to show you the aerial photo of the place, then display hovering around the cursor a slightly transparent map. For instance, take a look at this map of <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=public&X=533258&Y=180057&width=500&height=310&gride=529090&gridn=179645&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&pc=&zm=0&scale=10000&up.x=186&up.y=3">the Tower of London and the Tower Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>This trick is done completely in Javascript, located in <a href="http://www.multimap.com/static/global.js">global.js</a>, and uses the overlay.style.* properties that I've really only seen used in Javascript-based menus before. I'm a bit confused on how this works in IE, as it does not support alpha tranparency as this posting <a href="http://persistent.info/archives/2004/04/27/overlays">semi-transparent image overlays</a> discusses, but I suspect they accomplished it through careful use of transparency in the .gif overlay image. I'll have to investigate more.</p>

<p>There are probably many more other innovative uses of this type of transparency overlay tracking to the cursor that can be helpful in other web tools.</p>

The Javascript in http://www.multimap.com/static/global.js only sets the clipping for the overlay layer, since it changes everytime the user moves the mouse. The layer transparency (for overDiv) is set in http://www.multimap.com/static/ps_new.css . No need for transparent GIFs.

IE does support alpha transparency for layers, using their filter:alpha(opacity=x) declaration. As the posting on semi-transparent image overlays points out, IE doesn't support alpha transparency for PNG images.

<p>I keep an eye out for new ideas in Wiki technology (see my post from February <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/looking_at_wiki.html">Looking at Wiki</a>), and I recently became fascinated by <a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. It is sort of a one-page client-only Wiki written completely in Javascript and HTML. Like my <a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net">EditThisPagePHP</a>, it appears to be an elegant experiment to look into the future of this medium of user-editable content.</p>

<p>The key feature of TiddlyWiki is that instead of <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiName">WikiName</a> links leading to new pages, it displays a new set of <a href="http://www.cmswiki.com/tiki-index.php?page=MicroContent">microcontent</a> at the top of the current page, pushing your previous content toward the bottom of the page. Thus your link history is all on a single page rather then through your browser's back button. You really need to try it out to understand it.</p>

<p>In its current form, TiddlyWiki is still really more a technology demonstration than a useful tool, as you can't save the changes you make. However, there are people that are creating a <a href="http://www.patrickcurry.com/tiddly/">PHP TiddlyWink</a> based on it.</p>

<p>There are a number of things about TiddlyWiki that interest me. One is that it is more microcontent focused, rather then page focused. I've seen a few attempts to do blogs in Wikis and to date I have been unsatisfied -- part of the reason is that most blogs consist primarily of a chronological series of microcontent, whereas Wikis tend to be more oriented around pages. The ideas in TiddlyWiki may offer an alternative.</p>

<p>Another unique aspect of TiddlyWiki is its approach to link history. I'm not sure if new microcontent should appear at the top, as it does in TiddlyWiki, or at the bottom, but it certainly is an useful experiment.</p>

<p>TiddlyWiki also seems to also be an interesting way to create hypertext stories -- see for instance see the interactive fiction <a href="http://scribbling.net/projects/tiddlywiki/BabyDogSitter.html">Baby Dog Sitter</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I see TiddlyWiki as an encouragement to other Wiki designers to see what can be done with client-side Javascripts. One of the reasons that <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> feels so responsive is due to its use of Javascript, and <a href="http://www.oddpost.com">OddPost</a> does some amazing things emulating the Outlook mail client exclusively using Javascript inside a web page. <a href="http://www.flexwiki.com">FlexWiki</a> is one of the few other Wikis that use Javascript in novel ways; however, they are Microsoft-centric rather than standards-centric, so I've heard that some of their features don't work on Mozilla-family browsers. I'd like to see more experimentation combining Javascript and Wiki.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing what shakes out as this tool matures.</p>

BODY:
<p>A number of my posts have been about integrating different domains of knowledge in order to better understand how human behavior should be incorporated in the design of social software. I found <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">The Dunbar Number</a> in sociology, and both <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/four_kinds_of_p.html">Four Kinds of Privacy</a> and <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html">Progressive Trust</a> come from my work in the cryptography field. The topic of this post comes from the field of architecture.</p>

<p>In order to provide for <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html">Progressive Trust</a>, you need to establish what is known as an "Intimacy Gradient".</p>

<p>The concept of Intimacy Gradient comes from architect Christopher Alexander, in his book <a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/">A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i><a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn127.html">Pattern #127 - Intimacy Gradient:</a>

<p><b>Conflict:</b> Unless the spaces in a building are arranged in a sequence which corresponds to their degrees of privateness, the visits made by strangers, friends, guests, clients, family, will always be a little awkward.</p>

<p><b>Resolution:</b> Lay out the spaces of a building so that they create a sequence which begins with the entrance and the most public parts of the building, then leads into the slightly more private areas, and finally to the most private domains.</i></p></blockquote></p>

<p>In architecture there are always some areas of the house or building that are more public -- the entry, the living room, the atrium, etc., and areas that are more private such as bathrooms, bedrooms, and offices. In a good design there is some marker of change between these different areas -- it might be a difference in ceiling height, a stairway leading to a different floor, or a narrow entrance. As an example, in the classical Japanese tea house, you have to bow low before entering.</p>

<p>Failure to respect the Intimacy Gradient results in uncomfortable buildings. <a href="http://munnecke.com/gehry.htm">Tom Munnecke</a> reported about a Frank Gehry building at Case Western Reserve University:</p>

<blockquote><p><i> I asked many of the graduate students how they felt about their new environment. "Horrible," said one. "Like living in a refrigerator" said another. "We used to have comfortable offices and gathering places, and had the most wonderful conversations. Now everything is so sterile, and the acoustics so bad, that we can't do anything together. I have to go outside if I want any privacy."</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient is also used in other media. As I noted in my review of <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!

<p>One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.</p>

<p>The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.</i></p></blockquote></p>

<p>Entering through the refrigerator door raised the intimacy of the experience for the audience of that circus. Thus in spite of it being produced in a large auditorium it felt as up-close and personal as did the much smaller <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/circus_contrapt.html">Circus Contraption</a>.</p>

<p>The Intimacy Gradient exists in movies as well -- anywhere you see a scene taking place in a public space that transitions down through smaller and tighter shots ultimately to a closeup of a face it is much more intimate then just cutting to the closeup.</p>

<p>In social software design, there also needs to be an Intimacy Gradient. One of the problems with Wikis is that there is often very little transition between public and intimate, and doing so can be quite jarring. SocialText, a Wiki service vendor, is aware of this problem and is <a href="http://alevin.com/weblog/archives/001393.html">"seeking to add more layers to the 'intimacy gradient', without recreating the highly structured collaboration tools that exist today"</a>. Ross Mayfield outlines <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/08/12/collaboration_cases_and_spaces.php">this possible future Intimacy Gradient for SocialText</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>
<ul><li>The broadest tier is a guest space, available to all</li>
<li>The second tier is a knowledgebase, accessible to all employees and contractors</li>
<li>The third tier is product development, for employees and contractors bound by a confidentiality agreement</li>
<li>The fourth tier is for the core management team to share confidential financial and HR information.</li></ul></i></p></blockquote>

<p>These thoughts from an earlier post by <a href="">Ross</a> are also thoughtful:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>He is right that groupthink is avoided by a social network structure that allows a dynamic and diverse periphery to provide new ideas, but the core of the network needs to be tightly bound to be able to take action. 

<p>That's the main point of Building Sustainable Communities through Network Building by <a href="http://www.orgnet.com">Valdis Krebs</a> and June Holley. When studying a <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/categories/socialNetworks/2003/01/07.html">community over time</a>, they suggest a vibrant community is made up of four stages: </p>

<ol><li>Scattered Clusters</li>
<li>Single Hub-and-Spoke</li>
<li>Multi-Hub Small-World Network</li>
<li>Core/Periphery</li></ol>

<p>The ideal core/periphery structure affords a densely linked core and a dynamic periphery. One pattern for social software that supports this is an <a href="http://www.jacana.org.uk/pattern/P127.htm">intimacy gradient</a> (privacy/openness), to allow the core some privacy for backchannelling. But this requires ridiculously easy group forming, as the more hardened the space the more hard-nosed its occupants become.</i></p></blockquote></p>

<p>This is not just a problem for Wiki. There is an excellent paper on the web called <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/~konrad/docs/IJMMS-patterns-junestrand-keijer-tollmar.pdf">Design Patterns for Private and Public Digital Spaces in the Home Environment</a> where they explore how people used VNC (video-mediated communications, or more colloquially video-chat). They state:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The earlier "public" character of a traditional farmer's house or bourgeois flat (in Sweden) has disappeared with the modern housing planning. Instead, distinguishing the public from the private has become central during the industrial age, with the dwelling as an exclusively private place. Now, with the transition to an information society, it seems as if the concept of public space in the private dwelling has to be reconsidered, which also means that the borders between the private and the public at home have to be opened up.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The need to provide for an Intimacy Gradient in social software is clear; however, the techniques for showing the transitions between the gradients are not. For instance, in the original Netscape Communicator, when you connected with a secure SSL connection, the border around the edge of the window would turn blue, and a solid blue key would show up. However, most people didn't notice this change and no current browser does this; even the little locked icon at the bottom of Internet Explorer and often isn't visible if you have the status bar turned off or if you are using frames.</p>

<p><a href="http://ming.tv/flemming2.php/__show_article/_a000010-001289.htm">Flemming Funch</a> (and <a href="http://www.redtailcanyon.com/items/278391.aspx">mirror</a>) notes part of the difficulty is:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>As long as a certain chat room or Wiki page is accessible directly with a deep link, it is going to be very hard to make it feel more intimate than any other place I can reach with similar ease. So a hierarchical structure of links doesn't do it. On the web you can't force people to accept your hierarchy if it is all just links.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Part of the solution might come from the architecture world as well -- here are some other Patterns by Christopher Alexander (see the link for Alexander's resolutions for each):</p>

<ul><li><p><a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn31.html">Pattern #31 - Promenade:</a> Each subculture needs a center for its public life: a place where you can go to see people, and to be seen.</p></li>

<p><li><p><a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn61.html">Pattern #61 - Small Public Squares:</a> A town needs public squares; they are the largest, most public rooms, that a town has. but when they are too large, they look and feel deserted.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p><a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn69.html">Pattern #69 - Public Outdoor Room:</a> There are very few spots along the streets of modern towns and neighborhoods where people can hang out, comfortably, for hours at a time.</p></li></p>

<p><li><p><a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/ptn142.html">Pattern #42 - Sequence of Sitting Spaces:</a> Every corner of a building is a potential sitting space.

<p>Other lessons for social software from the architecture world are the concepts of "refuge and prospect", the "savanna theory", and "defensible space".</p>

<p><i>Refuge and prospect</i> come from the landscape architect <a href="http://www.landscaperesearch.org.uk/extra31/refuge.htm">Jay Appleton</a>. Prospect is a place where we can see others, and refuge is a place were we can retreat and conceal ourselves. A specific prediction of his theory is that people prefer the edges of a space more then the middle. Often prospect and refuge are in conflict, as a prospect tends to be expansive and bright whereas a refuge is small and dark, but there are cases where they are combined in one place; this is why we value private homes with a spectacular view so much, and why we pay so much to stay at <a href="http://www.djc.com/news/ae/11127729.html">scenic retreats</a>. So what are the edges of our social spaces? Are there ways that we can signal either prospect and refuge?</p>

<p>The <i>savanna theory</i> comes from a hypothesis by <a href="http://notes.utk.edu/bio/greenberg.nsf/0/f60081ef35fba95c85256e6e006a2a77?OpenDocument">Richard Coss and Gordon Orians</a> that we should be most comfortable with those landscapes where humans spent most of their evolutionary past. Thus supposedly the ideal landscape design has the same proportionality of trees, grass, and brush as the African savanna; parks and golf clubs are shown as evidence of this theory. An alternate to this theory is that we desire a certain amount of <a href="http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/student/html/erich/synekpro.html">visual complexity</a>. Either theory raises this question: what are the evolutionary markers regarding groups that our human ancestors needed? This question fits well with my thoughts regarding the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html">Dunbar Number</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>defensible space</i> concept comes from the idea that anonymous spaces lead to problems because of vandalism, incivility, and crime, and to eliminate those problems requires the residents to mark their "territories" and "take possession" of their areas. We have similar problems in the online world. So maybe the answer is similar -- allow more ways for groups of people to mark up and take possession of their own virtual spaces.</p>

<p>There are a couple of links that integrate these ideas in architecture that you might find useful:<br />

<p>We are still breaking ground and exploring new ideas in the world of social software. However, there are already extant fields of study which may give us insight into this new venue. Architecture is one of them. By better understanding ideas of intimacy gradients, pattern language, refuge and prospect, savannas, and defensible spaces, we may gain new understandings of how to build social environments which are attractive and enjoyable to more people.</p>

In order to provide for <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/08/progressive_tru.html">Progressive Trust</a>, you need to establish what is known as an "Intimacy Gradient".

The concept of Intimacy Gradient comes from architect Christopher Alexander, in his book <a href="http://downlode.org/etext/patterns/">A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction. (Oxford University Press, 1977)</a>. (post continues with a discussion of how this applies to social software)

Tried to post this elsewhere and failed. Sorry if it's duplication.

If a person loading a page has an identity or role (one could have many of these for different purposes) then the system serving the page could show different sets of links based on the "privacy level". Of course, one could show entirely different sets of links to different people. This du(multi?)plicity would also reflect the method commonly employed in social manipulation, i.e. saying different things to different people based on one's view of them.

As it stands, this suggests that the person providing the link sets owns the server, which is often not the case.  Alternatively, it suggests that one is happy to trust a service provider with one's most intimate secrets.  I suspect neither needs to be the case if cryptography is used.

Thanks for the great summary and roundup of key concepts, theories and techniques from architecture and urban planning that can be applied to social software design.  I'm also a big fan of these fields and I think we can stand to have a lot more cross-pollination between the worlds of software, and of space/place design.

As for how to simulate intimacy gradients, and more basic, "hardwired" ways that we behave in spaces and places, in the online world (or how to symbolize or substitute for them), I wonder:  Why don't we cheat more often?

People use our software in spaces and places, after all.  Instead of trying to -simulate- the physical, real-world intimacy mechanisms that we've evolved to use, why not just -use- those physical mechanisms and context cues that already exist?  Why not design software that's aware of the very different places we move through?  Why not design software and devices tied to places?  That's what we're trying to do in a few very specific ways with PlaceSite.com, but there's so much more that can be done here.

BODY:
<p>I believe that as we evolve social software to better serve our needs and the needs of the groups that we are involved in, we need to figure out how to apply an understanding of how human groups behave and work.</p>

<p>One useful concept I use I call "Progressive Trust". The basic idea is to model how trust works in the real world, between real people, rather then solely relying on mathematical or cryptographic trust.</p>

<p>This is how I typically explain progressive trust when I meet someone in-person at a conference:</p>

<p>You are now spending your most precious resource, that most unrenewable commodity -- time, in order to listen and understand what I have to say.</p>

<p>Why do you do so? Because by the act of us being here in this common space, at this conference, you have found a very simple credential from me--that I'm willing to spend time here in a place that you are interested in as well. In turn, I'm willing to spend more time chatting with you for the same reason.</p>

<p>Why do we continue to chat, and not move on to other people to discuss with? Because as we chat we are exchanging a number of credentials -- people we know in common, common interests, meaningful ideas, etc. We may also present credentials typically issued by others, like our business cards, or explain our relationship to the host.</p>

<p>As our unspoken agreement to continue discussion evolves, we typically will unconsciously check to see if others are listening, and adapt our conversation thereafter. If the discussion becomes more personal or serious, we will often find ourselves moving to a more private portion of the room. As our discussions become deeper, we may begin to speak of things that hint at a mutual respect for confidentiality.</p>

<p>Also early on we'll begin to scope out the nature of our time together. Is it only professional, or a potential friendship? Even intimate relationships go through this phase -- are we with someone who wants to date? Is is possible that a future date lead to something more?</p>

<p>If we agree to meet later to discuss more, before we meet again we may go authenticate some of the credentials given us. We'll not authenticate all of them, only enough to substantiate the level of assurance that we need for the risk we are taking (which may only be the future loss due to wasted time, but even that is a form of risk.) This authentication can consist simply of confirming information given, or it can be as complex as asking for an endorsement from a mutual colleague.</p>

<p>As our collaboration grows, we will find ourselves seeking more and more credentials, endorsements, etc., but they will not be enough. The next level of trust can only be established by experience of commitment -- for instance do we call back when we said we would? These tests typically start with small things, and then grow to larger things. At some point this may ultimately grow to form simple verbal contracts; over time richer, deeper social contracts are agreed upon that might not be written down.</p>

<p>Ultimately we may bring in third parties to witness, and thus possibly enforce our mutual obligations, whether it is just having a mutual colleague view our handshake or friends see us kiss, or whether it is having a legal, signed document.</p>

<p>At some point our mutual interests may be so large that we decide not just to collaborate, but to share assets, whether through a partnership, a corporation, or a marriage. Before this is complete there will be more credentials and authentication of those credentials (talk to former employees, engage in credit checks, visit each others' families, take blood tests), endorsements, and less risky tests of the full contract (signing a term sheet, or a marriage engagement).</p>

<p>This is the way human trust works. It also very similar to the way that groups work -- a corporation will collaborate with another corporation in the same way, starting with small trust, going on to tests, and leading ultimately up to partnerships and mergers.</p>

<p>Computer trust rarely works the way that human trust does. It starts with mathematical proofs--that such and such a mathematical algorithm is extremely difficult, thus something built on it must also be difficult. These are then built on top of each other until a system is created. It often seeks a level of "perfect trust" that is rarely required by human trust.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I chose to back the then nascent SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) Standard back in 1992-3, was that I felt that it much better mapped to the progressive trust model, and thus to human trust, then did its competitors.</p>

<p>At the time, the SET standard was backed by all the major players--Visa, Mastercard, Microsoft, etc. However, it not only required strong mutual authentication, but it also require multiple authentications. HTTPS was backed by RSA, required digital signatures, preferably by both parties. SSL was not necessarily a clear winner.</p>

<p>But SSL starts out very simple--first it just connects two parties, then it establishes simple confidentiality between them. If one party wants more confidentiality, they can upgrade to a stronger algorithm. Then one party can request a credential from the other, or both can. Either party has the option to request authentication of those credentials. Ultimately you could use SSL to come close to the level trust that SET tried to establish, but SSL isn't generally used that way because the market decided that only one party needed to send a credential--the merchant. SSL also proved to be more flexible then for use just with web pages or credit cards -- now it is used for things like securing email, creating VPNs, and playing online games.</p>

<p>Thus progressive trust is a useful conceptual model for understanding how trust might be built using online tools. Look at the tools that you are using now -- do they support various levels of trust, and a natural path between them? Or is trust more binary -- someone is only trusted, or not trusted. Are there implicit levels of progressive trust that are part of the culture of your group that might not embodied in the software itself?</p>

<p>Progressive trust also maps well to an user-interface design technique called <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ProgressiveDisclosure">Progressive Disclosure</a>. It sequences information and actions across several different windows in order not overwhelm the user. You disclose basic information and choices first, then revealing progressively more complex information and choices. Thus you help the user manage the complexity of the application. Navigating group interactions and culture is also complex, thus progressive trust allows you to hide some of initial complexity of the trust model behind your tools, and thus lower barriers of entry to your software.</p>

BODY:
<p>This is not a political blog, but like most bloggers I've been indundated with various discussions about the Bush Administration, Michael Moore, Red vs. Blue, etc. So much so that on some professional email lists we've had to ask the participants to use the text "[POLITICS]" in their subject lines so that we can filter out the overt political content.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why I tend not to participate in the political discussions is because most often they are polarizing. They tend to preach to the already converted, to harden the line, and often are too polemic. This was my problem with Farenheight 411 -- I thought there was some good stuff in the movie, but it was in a format that I didn't think would persuade the uncommitted. The first time the director used innuendo to oversell his points, and when he showed a lack of any respect for other points of view I think he lost the uncommitted audience.</p>

<p>Thus in general I've been reluctantly participating in the current political dialogue. I have contributed to various causes and campaigns, and have spoken to my friends about my thoughts on the subject, but I've not been bringing that activity online.</p>

<p><a href="http://sociate.com/blog/archives/2004_07_01_archive.html#109113435166448725"><img alt="BushArtSm" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/BushArtSm.jpg" width="140" height="175" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>However, I really do admire this statement on a t-shirt by <a href="http://sociate.com/">Jerry Michalski</a> <i>"Apparently half of you believe George W. Bush is an adequate president. I don't agree, and would love to talk about it respectfully"</i>.  I like it because because it clearly states the respect that is needed regarding the issues that the other half believe in. You may not agree with those issues, but you will be respectful to the person that believes them. Jerry has made this t-shirt available at <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/sociate.12621018">Cafe Press</a>.<a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/jont.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/jont.html','popup','width=304,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="jont" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/jont-thumb.jpg" width="100" height="157" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>

<p>Not quite as respectful, but done with conviction is a song by UK artist <a href="http://www.waragainstsleep.com/">Jont</a> that I like called <a href="http://www.yi-tan.com/mp3s/Jont-WorldGoneBlind.mp3">World Gone Blind (MP3 format)</a>, and is freely distributable under a Creative Commons' Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivitives License.

This is not a political blog, but like most bloggers I've been indundated with various discussions about the Bush Administration, Michael Moore, Red vs. Blue, etc. So much so that on some professional email lists we've had to ask the participants to use the text "[POLITICS]" in their subject lines so that we can filter out the overt political content. (post continues with more about why I don't participate much in political discussions, but then points people to a t-shirt statement and a song that I feel are respectful.)

BODY:
<p>In my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html">review</a> last January of the amazing <a href="http://www.les7doigtsdelamain.com/menu.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a> I talk about why I like circuses that are more raw and intimate, i.e. more "human" then the pretentious and distancing style of <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm">Cirque du Soleil</a>. However, I was disappointed that I saw the near-to-last show, so could not send my friends out to go see one of the great performances of the year.</p>

<p>Last night at the recommendation of <a href="http://finnern.com/2004/07/31.html#a714">Mark Finnern</a> I went to see <a href="http://www.circuscontraption.com/">Circus Contraption</a>, a marvelous burlesque-style musical comedy circus at the very intimate setting of the <a href="http://www.cellspace.org/">CELLspace</a> warehouse in San Francisco's Mission district. I arrived early and was able to grab a couch up front to view from (ala the Red Vic or Parkway Speakeasy movie theatres). </p>

<p>This year's show is "Grand American Traveling Dime Museum" which is particularly appropriate theme given the re-opening this month of the <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/08/01/PKGHI7U19K1.DTL">Musee Mechanique</a> on Fisherman's Wharf. The show plays at 9pm every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in August except for August 15th and August 29th, and is only $15!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/circus_contraption_1.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/circus_contraption_1.html','popup','width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="circus_contraption_1" src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/images/circus_contraption_1-thumb.jpg" width="100" height="75" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>

<p>The troupe consisted of twelve players, who performed almost two dozen acts (with an intermission in the middle) that ranged from clownwork, trapeze, ropework, tumbling, acrobatics, juggling, skits, stilts, puppets, etc., all set to music. What makes Circus Contraption truly unique is the risque nature of the acts, and the raunchy exuberance of the music numbers. With the Pickles Family Circus and Seven Fingers there is often a subtext of eroticism and sensuality, but as these are family shows these themes are not overt. Circus Contraption is quite overt and fun -- definitely rated R stuff.</p>

<p>I'd not put the athletic complexity of the circus acts up there with Seven Fingers or Cirque du Soleil, but that is also part of what makes them so fun. I particularly liked that most of the cast participated as musicians, clowns, and performers at different points of the show, giving a dynamism to the troupe -- you never knew who was going to do what. This also gave some authentic amateurism to the show ('amateur' meaning 'to love') that was delightful.</p>

<p>The musicianship of the troupe was superior (<a href="http://www.circuscontraption.com/audio/come2circus.mp3">sample</a>), and was up there with the great acts. I picked up a CD when I left and listened to it on the way home and it was a quality treat. The band is also playing on Monday's this month at "The Odeon" bar at 3223 Mission (at Valencia).</p>

<p>So if you are in the SF Bay Area this month, go run and get yourself a <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/398">ticket</a>. I hope to go again on August 27th.</p>

<p>I have for some time told people that one way that my blog was different was because I was focused on offering a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">high signal-to-noise ratio</a>. I told them that they could subscribe to my blog safely, as I'd not inundate them with anything but the highest quality posts.</p>

<p>At first, this meant that I'd not post unless I had something significant to add to the topic. No simple pointers to interesting ideas, no simple rephrasing, or simple agreement -- I had to add value.</p>

<p>For some time I think I succeeded -- I received a lot of praise for my posts on social networking, on internet security, on FOAF, on the Dunbar number, and on my tool EditThisPagePHP. However, I've found that for each post my standards were growing higher. My most recent posts took significantly more time to write, and I believe were much more like articles then they are like the typical blog post.</p>

<p>I haven't posted now for a couple of months, and I realized this week that part of the problem is that I've become intimidated by my own standard. For every new post to meet the quality of some of my best posts is too difficult.</p>

<p>So I'm lowering my standards somewhat -- I will be posting some more small, pithy topics, rather then my longer rants. However, I do hope to continue to offer a good signal-to-noise ratio, and still add value.</p>

Another advantage of posting shorter, less developed thoughts is that you can involve your audience in exploring your ideas.  It becomes a discussion with the community.

When my RSS tagged your blog as having something new, my first thought was, "I haven't read anything by Chris in a while, let's see what he's got".

I am not disappointed that it was this announcement. Looking forward to reading more of your insights.

I found the same thing when I started an email newsletter for my Stanford lab in 1998 or so. At first I thought the newsletter would contain unpolished ideas and simple pointers. But as time went on, I got pickier. I eventually starting writing 8 or 10 articles and then pre-testing those articles on willing readers in order to select the final 5 or 6 articles for the issue. As you can imagine, it took longer and longer to do each issue, making it harder to get them out the door. 

So now my lab is doing a blog. I'm hoping we can keep it fast and loose. But there is pressure from readers, even if it's just one person. For example, last month we deleted one of our posted article, and one reader wrote us with nasty things to say, as if we had violated some unwritten rule of blog culture.

First of all, let me point out that I just found your blog today, and I was really impressed by the quality of your comments. Having searched for good social networking articles for a while, I think that I found much more than I ever antecipated.

As for your 'confession', well, I understand it - I never posted anything before on a blog, because I was always afraid that I could not post good content. But in a world where any 15-seconds-of-fame celebrity can discuss the latest controversy with the same authority as a Ph.D on the topic, I think that I can lower my standards a little bit too. As for yourself, don't worry - your standards are already very, very high, lowering them a little bit will do no harm. In this muddy world, better to have a few rough gems than no gems at all.

When I first started paying serious attention to blogs I thought they were blogging for themselves, and their subscribers were interested in what they had to say, entertained, or a friend/family member.  I started my blog as a test to see if I liked it compared to old-fashioned HTML, which I'd done for a few years already.  I found out I loved blogging.  If I read something that moved me, or heard some news on the tv, or something special happened to me, I'd tell my blog.  Most times, it was news reports, or internet stuff that I blogged about.  If I wished I had someone around to tell, then it went in.  Sometimes I post a book, like this comment, while others might be just a few lines, with a link.

I've been getting about one comment a month recently (I've been blogging for 13 months); over half the time it's from people I've never heard of, but are very interested in whatever topic I posted about.  I still get excited if someone comments LOL; I got a new one today that brought tears to my eyes it was so beautiful.

A few months after I started blogging, I noticed  that some bloggers seemed to 'blog for an audience'.  Well, if they had an average of 10+ comments on most posts, I'd consider that a large enough audience to consider writing 'for'.  But me, I don't think I'd care for writing 'for an audience'.

But what really made me giggle is that some bloggers seemed to write for a large audiance as their main goal, even if there weren't many comments at all.  I'd wonder if they wanted something to make themselves feel special, bragging rights in RL, or just plain lonely.  Next I noticed many of the more popular posts instructed people on 'how to blog', promote blogs, ect  Ok, well maybe more people than I thought wanted a huge honking audience LOL.   I've noticed a recent trend to 'market blogs', so I guess that might be some bloggers goal, unless they're just trying to offset bandwidth costs. 

My favorite types of posts were when someone had important knowledge to share like 'blogging journalism', discovery, or specialized instruction like nanotechnology or server software. I also enjoy reviews of products, software, or services, whether they're good or bad reviews.  Pets and food rate high too LOL

Have fun with your blog, be passionate about your topics (that's why I subbed to you when you were looking into Orkut so closely), and I'll certainly enjoy your posts, short AND long.

BODY:
<p>I have been leading the design of a new Open Source collaboration tool called <a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index.php">EditThisPagePHP<a>, which started <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/editthispagephp.html">six months ago</a> and now is in beta.</p>

<p>My goal with EditThisPagePHP attempt to come close to <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer's</a> <a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/discuss/msgReader$641?mode=topic">visionary statement</a> back in May of 1999:</p>

<blockquote><i>When I'm writing for the web, and I'm browsing my own site, every bit of text that I create has a button that says Edit This Page when I view it. When I click the button, a new page opens with the text in an HTML textarea. I edit. Click on Submit. The original page displays with the change. Three easy steps. The essential element is that *every* bit of text has this button. There can be no exceptions.</i></blockquote>

<p>At the fundamental level, EditThisPagePHP basically just let you remotely edit a single page. There are many situations where existing Wiki or Blog software is too complicated, or imposes too much structure. EditThisPagePHP lets you have total control over the HTML -- you can use sophisticated CSS layouts, or very simple HTML -- the software does not get in the way.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this simplicity, EditThisPagePHP also uses ideas drawn from various Wiki, Blog, and CMS (content management system) technologies. Like Wikis, it supports an edit-this-page button, page history, page diffs, and can email users when pages change. Like Blogs, it supports optional user comments, trackbacks (both send and receive), and delivers two RSS feeds -- one for the current version of the page, and one with diffs. Like a CMS, it supports multiple roles, by default a reader, an editor, and a super-editor -- each with different privileges.</p>

<p>I personally plan to use it for standards documents, lists, game rules, and home pages for various groups I collaborate with. I expect that others will use it anytime a group of people want to maintain a publicly accessible page together.</p>

<p>Some screenshots:</p>

<p><a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/editpage.png" title="Edit Page"><img src="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/tn_editpage.png" border="0" width="150" height="128" alt="Edit Page" /></a><a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/history.png" title="View History"><img src="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/tn_history.png" border="0" width="150" height="128" alt="View History" /></a><a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/diffs.png" title="Page Diffs"><img src="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/tn_diffs.png" border="0" width="150" height="128" alt="Page Diffs" /></a><a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/trackbacks_comments.png" title="Trackbacks and Comments"><img src="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/tn_trackbacks_comments.png" border="0" width="150" height="128" alt="Trackbacks and Comments" /></a><a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/auth_msg.png" title="Edit Authorization Message"><img src="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/index-images/tn_auth_msg.png" border="0" width="150" height="128" alt="Edit Authorization Message" /></a></p>

<p><b>Technical Details:</b> EditThisPagePHP is written solely in PHP, and it currently works with PHP 4 and 5, and does not require SQL. Every revision makes a backup of itself, so no data can be lost. PHP is not allowed in the HTML text itself, to minimize security risks. Only two files are required: the core PHP script (editthispage.php) and a data file for your page. The core file can support as many pages as desired. The current version is <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/editthispagephp/editthispage-0.5b2.zip?download">0.5b2</a>, is licensed under a BSD-style license, and there is a <a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/demo_05b2/index.php">working sandbox demo</a> available to play with.</p>

<p>Future goals are to support more technical features, without losing the elegance and simplicity of the implementation. This may include limited Wiki TextFormatting or a simple WYSIWYG editor, HTML-tidy, some user-interface enhancements, etc. A complete list is available on our <a href="http://editthispagephp.sourceforge.net/home/wishlist.php">wishlist</a> page.</p>

BODY:
<p>I've been thinking about the nature of privacy a lot lately.</p>

<p>I've long been associated with issues of preserving privacy. I helped with anti-Clipper Chip activism in the early 90s and supported various efforts to free cryptography such as PGP and other tools built with RSAREF from export control. However, my efforts in these areas wasn't really focused on privacy -- instead my focus was on issues of trust.</p>

<p>I've always tried to be precise here. For instance, one of the uses of the SSL encryption software that I designed and sold at Consensus Development was to preserve privacy; however, I never sold it with privacy as a feature. Instead I clearly stated that SSL offered "message integrity", "confidentiality" and "authentication". Part of the reason that I never used the word privacy with SSL was that I felt that the concept of privacy was too overloaded -- or possibly orthogonal to issues of cryptographic security. Promising privacy was promising too much.</p>

<p>More recently issues of privacy have been coming up in my study of social software. It got started with <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/confirmed_email.html">my post about privacy issues in Orkut</a> and a general <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">insecurity and discomfort</a> with information made available in various social networking services. Later I wrote about <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/handcrafting_my.html">handcrafting my FOAF</a> which required me to re-think how and what information I wished to reveal about myself. More recently I was <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/04/annoyed_by_zero.html">stung by Zero Degrees</a> which still disturbs me greatly.</p>

<p>All of this has stewed in my head until I arrived at the <a href="http://www.cfp2004.org">Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference</a> this week here in Berkeley, where I met many of my friends and colleagues in the cryptographic security business, as well as advocates on issues of privacy in organizations such as <a href="http://www.eff.org">EFF</a> and <a href="http://www.epic.org">EPIC</a>. My thoughts have now gelled sufficiently to make some observations about privacy.</p>

<p>When people speak about privacy, they may actually be talking about very different forms of privacy: defensive privacy, human-rights privacy, personal privacy, and contextual privacy.</p>

<p><em>Defensive privacy</em> is the first form: it's about protecting information about myself that makes me vulnerable or makes me feel at risk. This type of information can include things like my social security number, my credit report, or non-financial things such as my medical records or my home address. For some of my female friends this includes things like their photographs and email addresses. All of this information can be misused by other individuals or organizations in one way or another to mess up my life -- and in fact defensive privacy is usually centered around protecting this critical information from those singular individuals or organizations, be they con men, stalkers, or the Mafia. Most of the current privacy issues on the Internet seem to fall into this category. This form of privacy has also not fared well in the US courts -- for instance, in 1974 the Supreme Court decided that your bank records belong to the bank, to do with as they see fit.</p>

<p>Closely intersecting defensive privacy is the category of <em>human-rights privacy</em>. When you are speaking with a European about privacy, this often is the type of privacy they are speaking of. This comes from their history: the Netherlands in the 1930s had a very comprehensive administrative census and registration of their own population, and this information was captured by the Nazis within the first three days of occupation. Thus Dutch Jews had the highest death rate (73 percent) of Jews residing in any occupied western European country -- far higher than the death rate among the Jewish population of Belgium (40 percent) and France (25 percent). Even the death rate in Germany was less then the Netherlands because the Jews there had avoided registration. (source: <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m2267/2_68/77187772/p4/article.jhtml">The Dark Side of Numbers</a>). Human-rights privacy differs from defensive privacy in that it is about how governments can abuse information, rather then individuals abusing information. I used to feel safe about human-rights privacy in the US, that there was no way that what happened in Europe could happen here, but now I have lost such confidence because of Bush and Ashcroft.</p>

<p>The third kind of privacy, <em>personal privacy</em>, is more unique to the United States. It is what Supreme Court Justice Brandeis in 1890 called "the right to be left alone". This form of privacy is often what the more Libertarian-oriented founders of the Internet mean when they talk about privacy. Personal privacy covers things like the "do not call registry", the various rights to do as we please in our own houses -- such as view pornography or play S&M games with our partners -- and the general right to not be interrupted or interfered with unnecessarily at home. This form of privacy has more basis in US law; the concept is based on an interpretation of the First, Fourth, and Fifth amendments of the US Constitution, but is not explicitly defined there. However, this form of privacy is guaranteed by the State of California Constitution which assures residents that they may pursue and obtain <a href="http://www.privacy.ca.gov/code/declaration.htm">safety, happiness, and privacy</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>contextual privacy</em> is what <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">Danah Boyd</a> calls the <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/04/14/why_privacy_issues_matter_to_me.html#004117">ickiness factor</a> in her blog, and also in her post at <a href=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/16/the_ickiness_factor.php">Many-To-Many</a>:<blockquote><em>Ickiness is the guttural reaction that makes you cringe, scrunch your nose or gasp "ick" simply because there’s something slightly off, something disconcerting, something not socially right about an interaction.</em></blockquote><p/>This category is very difficult to define, and is easily confused with other forms of privacy, but I believe it has more to do with an inappropriate level of intimacy. An example of this is when I discovered that my professional colleagues on Orkut could see that I was in a committed relationship, and in turn I could see that some of them were in open marriages. I don't think there is very much harm that can come from this information being revealed, however, it was "icky" because it was an inappropriate level of intimacy for a professional context.</p>

<p>All four of these forms of privacy can intersect -- for instance, Orkut allows you to reveal your sexual orientation, which could be used secretly by an employer to discriminate against you (defensive privacy), or by a future Ashcroftian government to violate your civil rights (human-rights privacy), might lead you to being bothered at home because of people who either agree with or disagree with your orientation (personal privacy), and often is inappropriate for casual professional acquaintances to be told about (contextual privacy).</p>

<p>I don't think any of this answers the question of how to solve problems of privacy, but I do believe that it can help when you are discussing privacy to be sure that you try to convey and understand each others' ideas of what privacy means.</p>

I came across this post looking for an information taxonomy in general and a taxonomy of identity in particular.

I'd like to know if you have any thoughts on the subject - or your readers.

As a beginning:
Civil identity information

Social identity information

Role identity information

Biometric identity information

Transaction identity information

Thanks!

BODY:
<p>As I'm studying social network software right now, I consider it my job to try many of the <a href="http://socialsoftware.weblogsinc.com/entry/2241460714746671/">hundred some odd social networks </a>out there right now.</p>

<p>I just joined <a href="http://www.zerodegrees.com">Zero Degrees</a>, and like many others, it asked me to upload my address book. I've done this before and usually it just finds those who already have joined these networks and links us together. Typically I delete my address book at this point, and don't bother to invite contacts that are not already members of that particular network.</p>

<p>However, Zero Degrees quite obnoxiously at the last "next" button, with no warning, invited <b>everyone</b> in my address book, and thus spamming my contacts. There was no opportunity given to me for it to just search for existing members. I aborted this as soon as I could, but about half of my address book contacts got spammed.</p>

<p>This probably explains some of the invitations that I've gotten from others that I didn't expect, thus I suspect that I'm not the only one that this has happened to.</p>

<p>So my apologies if you received "Yet Another Invite to Yet Another Social Networking Service" from me. I do not invite my collegues to <b>ANY</b> of these social networking services unless they ask me to, or they are already a member.</p>

<p>Thus if you are planning on experimenting with Zero Degrees, I don't recommend that you upload your contacts. I'm going to be a lot more careful with Zero Degrees in the future, and every other new service.</p>

<p><em>[update: It looks like <a href="http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/003050.html">Stowe Boyd got stung</a> by Zero Degrees as well, and Ross Mayfield has a <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/04/15/how_to_achieve_zero_degrees_of_separation.php">good screen shot of the "next" button</a> that caused the problem.

Funny how email sent by friendster to the friends invited is considered ok and email sent by zero degrees is called spam. You as a user initiated both emails but since you didn't like the results if by a bug in zero degrees process and if by not expecting your friends reaction you call the very legitimate email "SPAM" a name reserved to Viagra and low mortgages handlers and by that de-legitimate the whole thing...

Jakky, my personal opinion is that a SNS should *NEVER* send mass emails. Every relationship is precious, and each email from an SNS, whether an invite, a request, or a message, should be customized by the user for each recipient.

Given this, I think Orkut and Friendster are borderline "bad" because when you request a friend to join, you are not able to give a personal message. Worse practices are LinkedIn, Plaxo, and others that allow you to invite everyone in your address book at once without individual personalization. The absolute worst offenders are Zero Degree's "one click no warning" invite of everyone, and Orkut's "Friends of Friends" messages. These last two I believe qualify as as being evil enough to call spam.

BTW, at least a dozen of the errant emails that went out were blocked by spam filters. In particular it appears that you can't send messages from Zero Degrees to anyone at Earthlink.

BODY:
<p>While I've been out attending the <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">SXSW Music, Movie and Interactive Conference</a> there has been a flurry of high-quality postings about Social Networking.</p>

<p>Unlike many of my fellow bloggers, I find it difficult to post meaningful blogs while I'm on the road. It has been my policy in my own blog postings to also be "high-signal, low-noise", so normally I don't just post links without solid additional commentary, however, I'm making an exception this time because of the quality and depth of these entries.</p>

<h4>How Do We Categorize Relationships</h4>

<p>Clay Shirky writes in Many to Many <a href="http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/03/16/relationship_a_vocabulary_for_describing_relationships_between_people.php">RELATIONSHIP: A vocabulary for describing relationships between people</a> which is a commentary on a new proposal for <a href="http://purl.org/vocab/relationship/">mapping relationships</a> in <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a> (see also my previous blog on <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/handcrafting_my.html">FOAF</a>):<p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Here, just in case you were wondering, is how you should be characterizing your relationships with one another:</p>

<p>friendOf, acquaintanceOf, parentOf, siblingOf, childOf, grandchildOf, spouseOf, enemyOf, antagonistOf, ambivalentOf, lostContactWith, knowsOf, wouldLikeToKnow, knowsInPassing, knowsByReputation, closeFriendOf, hasMet, worksWith, colleagueOf, collaboratesWith, employerOf, employedBy, mentorOf, apprenticeTo, livesWith, neighborOf, grandparentOf, lifePartnerOf, engagedTo, ancestorOf, descendantOf, participantIn, participant</p>

<p>Describing relationships with a controlled vocabulary can sound credible right up to the moment you see the vocabulary, but this thing is a mess.<br/>
...<br/>
The RELATIONSHIP list should make it obvious that explicit linguistic clarity in human relations is a pipe dream. It probably won’t though — the madness of the age is to assume that people can spell out, in explicit detail, the messiest aspects of their lives, and that they will eagerly do so, in order to provide better inputs to cool new software.</a>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you read the comment's in Clay Shirky's blog entry -- some good discussion.</p>

<p>Ian Davis writes a response to Clay's posting in <a href="http://internetalchemy.org/2004/03/clayShirkyOnRELATIONSHIP">Clay Shirky on Relationship</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>There are a number of themes in Clay's post. The primary theme appears to be one of completeness: Clay's thesis is that the vocabulary is incomplete because it doesn't provide properties to model composite relationships: what if you are employed by a colleague you collaborate with?. Clay seems to be implying that he expects the terms to be exclusive. Of course they're not. It's perfectly meaningful to assert that Jane employedBy John and Jane collaboratesWith John. RDF supports this kind of assertion and you can also express it with the HTML method outlined in the vocabulary.<br/>
...<br/>
Obviously I'm pleased that Clay has taken the vocabulary seriously enough to critique in detail. Somehow the thought that everyone would ignore it caused me more concern than the fear that everyone would hate it.</p>

<p>Despite all the obvious thought Clay put into his piece, he still managed to overlook the raison d'etre for the relationship vocabulary. Indeed it's the raison d'etre for all vocabularies. Without these vocabularies, incomplete and imperfect as they are, we would be mute in the machine readable web, unable to express ourselves in any meaningful way. You only have to look at the etymology to realise that vocabularies give you a voice.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Like Clay I too am concerned with this relationship proposal, for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>First, I'm not sure that I like the "negative" relationships. There is a good argument against using negative relationships in the <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/background#positive">XFN Background</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>Negative relationship terms have been omitted from XFN by design.  The authors think that such values would not serve a positive ends and thus made the deliberate decision to leave them out. Such terms (we won't even bother naming them here) while mildly entertaining in a dark humor sort of way, only serve to propagate negativity.</p>

<p>The authors do not deny that such negative relationships exist in the real world today.  Of course they exist.  However, we see no need nor benefit to standardizing such relationships and capturing them in a form which would spread on the Web.  There is enough hatred in the world.  We should work to eliminate hatred, not to spread it.</p>

<p>And we do realize that by creating <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn">XFN</a> and the mechanisms it uses (<a href="http://gmpg.org/xmdp/">XMDP</a>), we have opened a Pandora's box, and have made it easier for those that would create and propagate negative relationships.  We can only hope that our positive creation wins out over any such negative creations.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Secondly, I am uncomfortable with both the relationships in <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a> and parallel ideas in <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn">XFN</a> because they in both proposals these are "exposed" publicly. I am comfortable with saying that I "knowOf" someone, but when forced to categorize publicly everyone even more precisely, I become uncomfortable. Am a I committing a faux-pas when I say that I am a "friendOf" someone when they think I'm a "closeFriendOf"?</p>

<p>Lastly, I'm concerned about complexity -- once you start down the slippery slope of defining relationships, things can get incredibly complex. Even if don't include concerns about ethnocentricity (as <a href="http://www.michael.bauser.name/20031225T045828Z">Michael Bauser writes</a>), there just seems to be no end in sight to how specific you might be required to be. Becoming more specific typically results in more precision, but in this case, as these are very fluid human (or even primate) definitions, wrought with emotion, may result in them being less precise. Maybe the real answer should be much simpler four: knowsOf, professionalColleagueOf, personalFriendOf, and shareFamilyWith.</p>

<h4>Are Social Networks Useful?</h4>

<p>Judith Meskill asks in <a href="http://www.meskill.net/archives/000565.html">Musings On Autonomic Social & Knowledge Networks</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i>If you utilize one or more of the current entrants in this swell of online SNS offerings [such as LinkedIn, Friendster, Orkut, Ryze, and/or Tribe] - what value, if any, do you derive from them? And, harkening back to the citation with which I started this post, has one [or more] of these services assisted in helping you to successfully reduce the 'traffic congestion' at the 'intersections' in your life? And, in closing, any insights, comments, or ponderings on the recent and future blurring of lines between 'wetware,' 'software,' and 'hardware' in an infinitely connected wireless world?</i></blockquote>

<p>Stuart Henshall answers in Unbound Spiral <a href="http://www.henshall.com/blog/archives/000817.html">Social Networking is Broken</a>:</p>

<blockquote><i><p>This slightly facetious statement: "My social networks are broken... at least I think they are." reflects my conclusion that the social networks I've been playing in are for the most part associative networks. While they have a social element the socializing for the most part takes place by blogs, forums, IM / e-mail, phone and in face to face visits.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It's time to put a stop to categorizing these "things" as social networks. Call them "Associative Networking Tools" or "Structured Association Tools" or something similar. Then you can create a bucket for them. The reason there is no real business model is they are just part of / or component towards building our capabilities to enhance "presence" and connectivity.</p>

<p>What have we learned.</p>

<ul><li>We don't socialize rather only associate through the Orkuts while we socialize using messaging, telephone and face to face visits.</li>

<li>The opportunity to connecting through friends is much greater than generally understood. Some successes have been achieved. </li>

<li>Virtual connections mean managing ones connections and presence has never been more important. </li>

<li>Structured services are creating problems where there were none before. From categories to access. And designating "artificial" forced levels of buddies or friendship.</li>

<li>Fragmenting association systems does not enable better connections.</li> 

<li>Integration on to my desktop (address book / IM systems) at minimum and preferably into my cellphone is required for there are few you can synch with and while one can upload addresses you can seldom download. </li>

<li>The sites themselves are seldom responsible for the association, the connective knowledge is broader than the networking sites. eg blogs, blogrolls, online forums etc.</li></ul>

Denise Klarquist writes in <a href="http://weblog.cheskin.net/blog/archives/000216.html">SNAM - Too much of a good thing?</a> (via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a394">Dinah Mehta</a>):

<blockquote><i>Each time I'm invited to join or add someone (frequently unknown to me) to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> network, or asked to update my contact information via <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a> (again, usually by someone I barely know) I wonder how far my online social network extends. And how useful it really is. I'm still intrigued and excited by the possibilities of online social networking. But I'm hoping to see more of the benefits before the noise dampens my enthusiasm.</i></blockquote>

<p><A href="http://www.chriscorrigan.com/parkinglot/">Chris Corrigan</A> offers a similar concern in a comment in Dinah Mehta's blog <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0121664/2004/03/17.html#a395">Social Networking - Too Much Noise?</a>:

<blockquote><i>
<P>"Seems to me that social networks have a hard time existing in the absence of a reason to do so. I have played around on Ryze and Orkut and to be honest they hold no glamour for me. I have a number of real life social networks from whence my business comes, and my weblog provides me with another social network from which I derive a lot of learning.</P>

<P>But I could never find a reason for the Ryze's and Orkuts of the world. And without a reason to network, networking becomes just noise.</p>

<P>One application for these types of things that I am working with a little is using social networking software to support emerging Aboriginal leaders here in British Columbia Canada who are working on interesting things in remote and far flung communities and who will really benefit from have some contact with each other. </p>

<P>But I wouldn't dream of inviting them to Ryze. Interesting, eh?"</p>

BODY:
<p>Lately I've been noticing the spread of a meme regarding &quot;Dunbar's Number&quot; of 150 that I believe is misunderstanding of his ideas.</p>

<h3>The Science of Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Dunbar is an anthropologist at the University College of London, who wrote a paper on <a href="http://www.bbsonline.org/documents/a/00/00/05/65/bbs00000565-00/bbs.dunbar.html">Co-Evolution Of Neocortex Size, Group Size And Language In Humans</a> where he hypothesizes:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... there is a cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships, that this limit is a direct function of relative neocortex size, and that this in turn limits group size ... the limit imposed by neocortical processing capacity is simply on the number of individuals with whom a stable inter-personal relationship can be maintained.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar supports this hypothesis through studies by a number of field anthropologists. These studies measure the group size of a variety of different primates; Dunbar then correlate those group sizes to the brain sizes of the primates to produce a mathematical formula for how the two correspond. Using his formula, which is based on 36 primates, he predicts that 147.8 is the &quot;mean group size&quot; for humans, which matches census data on various village and tribe sizes in many cultures. The following chart shows the distribution produced by Dunbar's analysis:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.bcg.com/images/this_is_bcg/strategy_institute/brain_size_02.gif" /><br /><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Source: <a href="http://www.bcg.com/strategy_institute_gallery/gorilla3.asp">Boston Consulting Group</a></span></p>

<p>This number of 150 has become &quot;Dunbar's Number&quot; and has been popularized by various very popular business books such as Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a> (<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0111705/categories/collaboration/2003/12/21.html#a358">summary</a>), Duncan J. Watts' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041425/ref=pd_skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age</a> (<a href="http://www.cmu.edu/joss/content/reviews/Podolny/">review</a>) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691005419/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Small Worlds: The Dynamics of Networks between Order and Randomness</a> (<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200008/rev-chow.pdf">review</a>), and Mark Buchanan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393041530/ref=skotostech-20/102-9060851-3407332">Nexus: Small Worlds and the Groundbreaking Science of Networks</a> (<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/template/BookReviewTypeDetail/assetid/16209;jsessionid=baadd3W3trYipI">review</a>), the ideas from which are the foundation of the various Social Network Services that I've discussed elsewhere in this blog.</p>

<h3>Revisiting Dunbar's Number</h3>

<p>Lately, Dunbar's number has been taken as a mean size for online networks and groups, as shown in <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html#a284">Ross Mayfield's Weblog</a>, where he states:

</p><blockquote>
<table border="1"><tbody><tr>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Network</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Size</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Description</span></strong></td>
<td><strong><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Distribution</span></strong></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Political Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~1000s</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as mass media</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Power-law (scale-free)</span></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Social Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~150</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogging Classic</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Bell-curve (random)</span></td></tr>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Creative Network</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">~12</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Blogs as dinner conversation</span></td>
<td><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">Dense (equal)</span></td></tr></tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Dunbar's work itself suggests that a community size of 150 will not be a mean for a community unless it is highly incentivized to remain together. We can see hints of this in Dunbar's description of the number and what it means:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The group size predicted for modern humans by equation (1) would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.<br />
...<br />
My suggestion, then, is that language evolved as a &quot;cheap&quot; form of social grooming, so enabling the ancestral humans to maintain the cohesion of the unusually large groups demanded by the particular conditions they faced at the time.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Dunbar's theory is that this 42% number would be true for humans if humans had not invented language, a &quot;cheap&quot; form of social grooming. However, it does show that for a group to sustain itself at the size of 150, significantly more effort must be spent on the core socialization which is necessary to keep the group functioning. Some organizations will have sufficient incentive to maintain this high level of required socialization. In fact the traditional villages and historical military troop sizes that Dunbar analyzed are probably the best examples of such an incentive, since they were built upon the raw need for survival. However, this is a tremendous amount of effort for a group if it's trying not just to maintain cohesion, but also to get something done.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Dunbar specifically restricts himself to physically close groups:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>... we might expect the upper limit on group size to depend on the degree of social dispersal. In dispersed societies, individuals will meet less often and will thus be less familiar with each, so group sizes should be smaller in consequence.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>My anecdotal evidence generally seems to support the idea that group sizes will usually plateau at a number lower than 150 participants. This comes from 20 years of doing facilitation both on and offline, running several software companies, and running various forums at America Online. In particular, many online communities provide good evidence for Dunbar's Number actually being an upper limit (either due to reduced efficiency or due to increased dispersion).</p>

<h3><a name="onlinecommunities">Dunbar &amp; Online Communities</a></h3>

<p><em>Ultima Online</em> provides one of the best examples of what sizes an online community will support because it's well documented and the overall game size is large enough to generate many smaller communities. If you look at <a href="http://www.legendmud.org/raph/">Raph Koster's</a> statistics for the size of groups in <em>Ultima Online</em>, you will see a definite point of diminishing returns at around 150; however, you will also see that most groups are around 60 large.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/UOGuildHistogram.jpg" alt="UO Guild Histogram" /></p>

<p>Jessica Mulligan, executive producer at <a href="http://www.turbinegames.com/">Turbine Games</a>, confirmed these numbers to me:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The numbers match up with my (currently) mostly anecdotal evidence for <a href="http://ac.turbingames.com">Asheron's Call</a>.&nbsp; We have allegiances in the hundreds and even thousands of members, but most of those members are inactive, non-participatory in the group on a regular basis or are mule accounts for farming XP.&nbsp; It is rare to have more than 40 or so active participants in an Allegiance.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I've seen similar limits myself in some of the small online games that <a href="http://www.skotos.com">Skotos</a> produces. For instance, in <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach">Castle Marrach</a>, which is a social-dominant game (i.e. like a MUSH), the game grew quickly until we reached approximately 150-200 active users. However, whenever it grew beyond that number, it always seemed that politics and dissatisfaction would bubble up such that people would drop out, leaving us back close to 150 or 160. (That we would ever exceed 150 is a bit of a surprise, but I think it's due to any number of factors, including a variable 24-hour user base, wherein on a given day we might only see a little more then half of our community members, below Dunbar's Number, and only get up to close to 200 or so over a full week.)</p>

<p>We have had some games at Skotos that do manage to overcome Dunbarrian social limits, prime among them <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/eternal-city">The Eternal City</a> which regularly exceeds the Marrach community by more then double. However, TEC is a much more achievement-oriented game, meaning that people spend much of their time interacting with the environment -- fighting monsters and training skills as it happens -- rather than directly interacting with other players all the time. Thus social limits become less important.</p>

<p>Other online communities that I've had experience with have been more traditional, and thus more closely met my expectations for Dunbar's Number acting as a limit rather than a mean. When I managed the Mac Developer's Forum community on AOL, a forum would start to break down when it reached about 80 active contributors, requiring a forum split before continued growth could occur. Wikis provide another good example; the WikiPedia, one of the largest active Wikis online, appears to have hovered at approximately 150-175 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">active administrators</a> for over a year, in spite of a huge growth in usage during the same period.</p>

<p>These numbers just keep coming up.</p>

<p>This all leads me to hypothesize that the optimal size for active group members for creative and technical groups -- as opposed to exclusively survival-oriented groups, such as villages -- hovers somewhere between 25-80, but is best around 45-50. Anything more than this and the group has to spend too much time &quot;grooming&quot; to keep group cohesion, rather then focusing on why the people want to spend the effort on that group in the first place -- say to deliver a software product, learn a technology, promote a meme, or have fun playing a game. Anything less than this and you risk losing critical mass because you don't have <a href="http://www.doceo.co.uk/background/requisite_variety.htm">requisite variety</a>.</p>

<p>

Thus Dana Boyd gets it right when she uses the word MAXIMUM in her <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/11/my_etech_talk_revenge_of_the_user.html">eTech Talk</a>, not average or mean:

</p><blockquote><p><em>[Dunbar] found that the MAXIMUM number of people that a person could keep up with socially at any given time, gossip maintenance, was 150. This doesn't mean that people don't have 150 people in their social network, but that they only keep tabs on 150 people max at any given point.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Expanding Dunbar's Numbers</h3>

<p>To open up the discussion a bit, I'd also hypothesize that Dunbar's Number is just one datapoint in an overall equation describing what group sizes work and what don't. Working our way up from the smallest group sizes, I think we can find many break points, both above and below Dunbar's Number of 150.</p>

<p>In my experience the smallest viable group size seems to be somewhere in the range of 5 to 9.</p>

<p>Looking smaller, we see that a group of 2 can be tremendously creative (ask any parent), but often has insufficient resources and thus requires deep commitment by both parties. Notably, often the difficulty of a 2-person business partnership is compared to that of a marriage. A group of 3 is often unstable, with one person feeling left out, or else one person controlling the others by being the &quot;split&quot; vote. A group of 4 often devolves into two pairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my opinion it is at 5 that the feeling of &quot;team&quot; really starts. At 5 to 8 people, you can have a meeting where everyone can speak out about what the entire group is doing, and everyone feels highly empowered. However, at 9 to 12 people this begins to break down -- not enough &quot;attention&quot; is given to everyone and meetings risk becoming either too noisy, too boring, too long, or some combination thereof. Although I've been unable to find the source, I've heard of some references to a study from the 1950s that says that the optimum size for a committee is 7. Likewise, it's fairly easy for us to see and agree that a dinner party starts to break down somewhere above 7 or 8 people, as do also tabletop games of both the strategic (I prefer 5) and role-playing varieties (I prefer 7). These size limits can be overcome, but require increased amounts of &quot;grooming&quot;. </p>

<p>The chasm that starts somewhere between 9 to 12 people can be especially daunting for a small business. As you grow past 12 or so employees, you must start specializing and having departments and direct reports; however, you are not quite large enough for this to be efficient, and thus much employee time that you put toward management tasks is wasted. Only as you approach and pass 25 people does having simple departments and managers begin to work again, as it starts to really make sense for department heads to spend significant time just communicating and coordinating (and as individual departments become large enough to once again allow for the dynamic exchange of ideas that had previously occurred in the original 5-9 member seed group).</p>

<p>I've already noted the next chasm when you go beyond 80 people, which I think is the point that Dunbar's Number actually marks for a non-survival oriented group. Even at this lower point, the noise level created by required socialization becomes an issue, and filtering becomes essential. As you approach 150 this begins to be unmanageable. Once a company grows past 200 you are really starting to need middle-management, but often you can't afford it yet. Only when you get up past that, maybe at 350-500 people, does middle-management start really working, primarily because you've once again segmented your original departments, possibly again reducing them to Dunbar-sized groups.</p>

<p>The following chart shows anecdotal satisfaction ratings for these lower group sizes:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/GroupSatisfaction.jpg" alt="Group Satisfaction" /></p>

<p>Much of this is probably predicted by Dunbar's model, if you add in the non-survival and dispursed community modifiers that I discuss here. Essentially, as we increase group sizes beyond 80, to 150, 200, or even 350-500, we typically do so by breaking larger groups down into smaller ones, and continually reducing community sizes down to the point where they can be understood and managed by people -- and so efficiency reasserts itself.</p><br />

Chris, this is a very impressive and useful piece of thinking - quite a contribution. 

The formulation '7 plus or minus 2', which I have often heard (and used) over the years as an ideal team size is well-supported by your thinking. It's worth noting that team-size in thriving real-world team games (basketball, baseball, US football) hover in this area.

Chris,

Pretty amazing stuff. I'd like to add another break-point. It is anecdotal (but amazingly consistent based on my experience.)

I was part of a company that grew very quickly both organically and through acquisition. In every single office, things worked as you stated from 5-8(or 9), broke down until about 25 and then stabilized. However, the next breaking point was consistently between 50 & 60.

It became my theory after witnessing this again and again that at around 40 people, the *PHYSICAL SPACE" requirements become so large, that you can't easily shout across them. This may sound silly, but what that physical separation creates is a dynamic where decisions are made on "one side" without the "other side" being involved.

Up to this point most everyone feels included in the whole because news travels so fast, and is often within earshot. Once we passed 40, the only news that travels fast is bad news and "secrets." ;-)

After much trial and error in trying to scale up offices with "teams areas" of multi-disciplinary folks, we ended up creating physical pods which accomodated 25-35 people. This allowed enough people to manage and have economies of scale, but small enough for quick communications.

The 80 breaking point is certainly when the next breakdown began in those offices that grew that big, but it wasn't until we got closer to 100 that the crap really hit the fan.

Hope this adds to the discussion and again... wow on the piece.

Nice job. FYI, we have intentionally segmented the forums on SWG and other games in order to reduce the admin load--this also entailed getting rid of the “general” forum, because it served as an attractor for too many people. Smaller communities of interest prove to be far more manageable from a policing point of view because of peer pressure and tighter social strictures.

Interesting stuff.  But, what is a "group"?  If it means 'the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships', the what is "stable" and what is a "relationship"?  What is the context of relatedness?  Is the point of orientation a conversation? a product?  a service?  an battle? a political action committee?

Well put, its important people understand the scaling limits at 12 and 150.  I never ventured a guess at optimal group size, as its heavily context dependent. Instead I would suggest that our challenge as creators of social software is to enhance social capital so productive teams can be dynamic while extending their limits with cohesion.

Great stuff, Christopher!

I like to include the following in explanations of the 147.8 number, because the range is pretty large (100 to 231):

"Because the equation is log-transformed and we are extrapolating well beyond the range of neocortex ratios on which it is based, the 95% confidence limits around this prediction (from formulae given by Rayner 1985) are moderately wide (100.2-231.1)."

Interesting. I just finished an analysis of the e-learning industry here in New Brunswick, Canada. of the 40+ companies surveyed, almost all of them were less than 8 or more than 50 employees. Nobody in the middle, as it seems that's an uncomfortable place to be.
Also, I remember reading about W.L Gore Assoc, who insisted that all of their plants have less 150 people. More than that and they would create another plant, even if it was next door. Something about group cohesiveness.

The references to Ultima Online parallel my experiences with the game. Most guilds that I socialized with or had battles with showed the most solidarity with only 5 to 8 players present in the same area. With too many players, things would get 'silly' as players would become bored. Also, too many players in a guild would cause fragmentation since players could never be on at the same times or preferred to play in a different part of the world. When I played, the largest guild around was HKU (Hong Kong Union) with 230+ members. It was a common occurrence to spot two HKU members fighting in anger. I have no idea how the guildmaster of HKU managed to get any actual game play in. :)

Just wanted to add my agreement. The larger the general communities get, the weaker the signal in any discussion. I think barriers to globally-broadcast participation can alleviate that to some extent. For instance, we charge some in-game currency (gold) to post on the in-game
general forums. We're even considering charging gold to file a complaint against another player, as the validity (signal) of people's complaints
(communication) against others has also declined as the population as gotten larger.

Chris, Must be tough keeping up with all the compliments :-). Let me add mine but also point back to Raph's comment earlier. The most amorphous piece here is the defintion of a group. I would also suggest that as opposed to non-human primates, humans have the ability to segment their neocortical capacities discretely between various groups and for various function - they can change roles completely. Thus we have multiple networks layered on top of each other - some w/ 2 members, some with 1000 and we swap our focus among them depending on our task, goal, etc.

I think that Dunbar's number is a strong predictor of a single group's optimal size but not so much of an individual's capacity to maintain multiple social contexts.

Although I haven't read Dunbar's work directly, the material I have read suggests that individuals are keeping track of "who did what to whom", suggesting that group complexity grows as n^2. When n=40, we're well within our limits, and we can handle many groups of such size (and we all have multiple social groups). My theory is that when n=150 or greater, we're pushing the boundary, and our ability to handle multiple social groups is diminished.

Marvin Harris, noted anthropologist, says in his book "Our Kind" (isbn:0060919906) that you can find no cases of larger groups forming except when there is both direct military power and no place to else to go. Let me reemphasize this: In no case in history can we find groups that voluntarily formed that were significantly larger than Dunbar's number. Larger groups formed only when agricultural communities created food, that food was controlled by a chief who had armed guards/police, and it was impossible to splinter off into a new tribe because there was no other life-sustainining land to go to.

Anthopological research shows that primate groups thirve at about the size of 30 members. Human tribes in traditional tribal communities around the world demonstrate that same ideal number.

Here's a thought: If you we could manage group relationship the way of some sports leagues, we would maintain A, B, C... Groups.  We would work with each of these groups differently and communicate in different ways.  Individuals could move up and down as their relevance to our current activity changes.

You know come to think of it... I think I already do group people like that! The A's are the ones I meet with in person at least once in a while. The B's are the ones I call at least somewhat frequently and the C's are the ones I email with. 

I guess there's a group that could be an A+ which are people who have directly lead me to business or are current customers. That would be a very short list, but the most protected and fruitfull. 
 
In that paradigm, these tools are helping me turn C's into B's and A's, and helping me grow my C farm. The more C's I have which can be turned into B's and A's, the better my networking results!

Dunbar would agree with your main point: "... the suggestion [in his paper] is simply that there is an upper limit on the size of groups that can be maintained by direct personal contact. This limit reflects demands made on the ancestral human populations at some point in their past history. Once neocortex size has evolved, other factors may of course dictate the need for smaller groups. Precisely this effect seems to occur in gibbons and orang utans: in both cases, neocortex size predicts groups substantially larger than those observed for these species, but ecological factors apparently dictate smaller groups."

I've never seen this stuff before but it jibes really well with a hypothesis I had made, based on personal observation of group dynamics in my local pagan community, particularly the coven(s) with which I have worshipped the last seven years.  The points at which the dynamics change seem to hover around powers of two:  one person, two people, three or four people, five to eight, etc.   While thirteen is a traditional "target" the groups I've circled with have ranged in membership from three to thirty.

In my observation, when a group fell below five active members for more than a few weeks it either sought out new students, merged with another small group, or dissolved completely.  Groups ranging from five to ten members tended to be most stable, with all members actively participating under the "leadership core" of two to four persons.  Groups of nine to fifteen people tended to split into "active" and "less-active" members with the active component having five to nine participants.  This commonly led to less active members either dropping out entirely (reducing overall group size) or complaning mightily about being left out.   The one group which grew above fifteen participants, reaching thirty at its maximum, was extremely unstable as the leadership core struggled to coordinate three sub-groups, each of whom complained mightily about lacking the leaders' attention and feeling left out... 

It seems that the 16-32 person group is the one that really needs a leader, though leadership develops at the 9-15 level. Would be interested in seeing if someone has applied this direction of thought (Dunbar's number, etc) to decision-making processes in groups.  A group that can't make a decision can't (as a whole) do much of anything else, either.

Sébastien Paquet had a comment in his blog http://radio.weblogs.com/0110772/ I thought was interesting: "Note that if this graph is accurate, jury duty (size=12) must be pretty nerve-wracking!)"

I hadn't even thought of jury duty as an example, and I just recently was foreman of one.
With only one example my experience is purely anecdotal, but I think the value of 12 in a jury is that that the group isn't cohesive, and has a tendency to break into two groups, i.e. guilty and innocent. Then it is up to those two groups to persuade each other one way or another.

Also, a smaller jury pool might allow for someone's personality to win over some else's judgement. Not that this don't happen anyhow, just that with 12 people you are more likely to find someone with a like opinion and you'll be able to stand with them against the strong personality.

Dunbar's original work was concerned with social groupings that were effectively the whole of an individual's "stable relationships".  Ignoring for a moment his insight as to the utility of language in lowering the cost of social grooming, would this not suggest that an individual's stable relationship total should be aggregated over all groups - so that if you're in a role-playing guild of, say 70, have a close-knit extended family of, oh, 40, you're not going be be able to sustain a business (or blog) network of more than about 40.  Now, adding language back in should allow these numbers to grow, but I guess the point is that the limit is individual-based, rather than group-based.

Someone asked me via email "Is there a format for assessment which you have found useful which you share with others?"

I've been thinking about assessment, but I'm not sure about how to approach it.

One argument is to look at it from an individual perspective. Their approach says that each individual has a max 150 meaningful relationships, so if they have 50 professional relationships, 50 personal relationships, they only have room for relationships with a group of 50 additional people. Thus for you to join another group of 10 you need to triage your existing relationships and drop 10 relationships.

The problem with this approach is that although there is probably some truth to it, it doesn't lend itself to understanding how assess how group works. Does in a new group of 10 each person all only have "room" for 10 more people in each of their networks -- that is doubtful. So there must be separate group dynamics involved with group sizes other then just the Dunbar number.

I have a question about that last graph -- the Group Satisfaction one. What is its source? Is it just a visual representation of the anecdotal experience that precedes it? Because if so, it should really be labeled as such. Otherwise it carries the same validity weight as the other graphs, which represented empirical data.

Dunbar says that human group size, "...would require as much as 42% of the total time budget to be devoted to social grooming.," and you suggest, "Some organizations will have sufficient incentive to maintain this high level of required socialization," as long as they're "...built upon the raw need for survival."
It is interesting in that regard that two groups of professionals who habitually deal with the "raw need for survival," soldiers and sailors, are often characterized by their love of conversation, "war stories," "yarning," and the like, a social-grooming pastime that may approach the percentage of waking hours that Dunbar mentions.

Belbin did studies on working groups in the 80s and discovered that there were 8 roles in play and each had its part to play in the group objectives.  The best groups were 4 to 8 sized, and the optimal was 4, where each person fulfilled 2 roles.  (Of course this was latter statistically unlikely.)

Unfortunately, there is very little info on Belbin on the net, as the work is sold as a sort of corporate training aid.

Several comments:

- Running live-action role-playing adventures, I have found that the ideal size of an adventuring group is around eight to ten players &mdash; this allows for one or two players to hang back and recuperate while the others interact, as it can otherwise be fairly draining to be in character for hours or days at a time, and the interactions get a bit sparse with fewer than six participants.

- There is a religious community in Canada that lives together and practices low tech farming.  Their farms are not necessarily adjacent to one another, and each farm has up to about 100 members.  Whenever a farm begins to approach this limit, it starts the process of splitting in two.  This involves working together to acquire a new piece of land, build the new buildings, and prepare everything needed in the new location.  The group splits into two, and each chooses a leader.  On the night before the move, everyone packs &mdash; in both groups.  The inhabitants of the new place are not determined until the day of departure.  On the morning of the move, the two leaders flip a coin to decide which will go and which will stay.  This has the function of investing everyone in the new buildings.  In order to replicate this growth strategy, of course, one would have to make sure everyone felt their survival depended on the community, and that they would be willing and able to relocate that investment from time to time.  Not so hard online.  Rather more difficult in the real world.

- Someone is going to start claiming that Dunbar's analysis doesn't hold, due to evidence from the recently discovered "hobbits" of Flores Island &mdash; comparative complexity of mental capacity in a much smaller brain-case.  I offer a pre-emptive counter-argument, in the form of an amendment to Dunbar's anaylsis.  The graph of brain size vs group size might equally well represent brain complexity vs group size.  Someone should re-analyze the data on the basis of complexity of the neocortex (or even of the whole brain), rather than its size, in order to back this up.

Don't you think that with the advent of computer technologies, the dunbar number has lost its relavance? I mean with all these modern gadgets like computers and Cable Television, people have lost the will and the art to communicate with others. About 10 Years back, there was enough time after work for members of a family to get together after a hard day's work to discuss about their current day and have relavent communication. But now there is no time for any communication at all in this fast paced world. And if at all  there is time, it is spent in front of the Idiot box (TV) or the more intelligent idiot box (computer) surfing the web.
So much for communication!!

I believe the significance of the range of 5 - 9 may come from "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information" (1956) by George A. Miller, cognitive psychologist. Another thought: with language comes the ability to think to oneself, thereby increasing the number of people in one's tribe by at least one or two (more for Sybil) ...

Ok, this is ridiculous.  Some assertions here must be answered.  People can maintain more than 150 relationships.  The idea that people can only keep up with 150 people is clearly outside the assertions of Dunbar's work.  Dunbar only says that the maximum sustainable size of a single group is somewhere between 100 and 230 with a 95% confidence.  (With the mathematical tendency toward 148.something)  This is for a single group with all members fully invested in the group.  The real limit in the human mind is the ability to keep track of the relationships between all 150ish people.  If the maximum size of a single undivided social network with no outside relationships is 150, his research therefore suggests that the average number of relationships a person can keep track of is 11,175 inter-relationships (1 interrelationship between every possible group of 2 people).  It is wrong-headed to say that the limit on a single network of 150 means that someone couldn't have a network of 50 people in their family network, 70 people in their work network, and another 70 people in their friends network.  If these networks are fully separate, then there are only 6,055 total inter-relationships, which lends credence to later research by H. Russell Bernard and Peter Killworth showing the average modern American maintains a social network of mean 290 members (median 231 members).

Thanks for this writeup on Dunbar's number, and your scholarship into it.  I followed a Twitter message from Luis Suarez to this blog posting.  

When Malcolm Gladwell was lecturing on "The Tipping Point" at the Rotman School at the University of Toronto, I asked him specifically about the number 150 (in particular, on the Goretex example cited in the book).  He didn't explain that the number 150 was associated with Dunbar, but instead referred to Thomas J. Allen at MIT.  I had found a copy of the 1997 book "Managing the Flow of Technology" in an old booksale, which wasn't very satisfying.  I now note that Allen has a 2006 book on "The Organization and Architecture of Innovation" which would be contemporaneous with "The Tipping Point".  

Now that you've provided with the direct source of the citation, you've opened up the academic bottleneck for me.  I appreciate your writing.

It is interesting in that regard that two groups of professionals who habitually deal with the "raw need for survival," soldiers and sailors, are often characterized by their love of conversation, "war stories," "yarning," and the like, a social-grooming pastime that may approach the percentage of waking hours that Dunbar mentions.

What a nice collection of reflections on the Dunbar Number. 
I would like to add a different formula that I created when studying human groups for my PhD. 

A = R + (Sq.Rt)M

where A = attendance at meetings
M = number of formal roles (eg. chair, secretary, coach, etc)
M = total number in group membership
and of course SqRt is Square Root (won't use the symbol in case the ascii doesn't work for anyone)

I have found it a pretty good predictor of meeting size all my (post-PhD) life. 
It is usually more pessimistic that the anticipations of group members that organize the meetings.  Sometimes I explain that the best way to increase the attendance is to introduce more (real) roles..... sometimes not, as you are not always thanked for suggestions.

I have always felt a fondness for the formula as it is one of the very few non-statistical uses of number in Social Psychology, and it seems a good predictor.

For this reason I throw it into the discussion.

The original publication was in my PhD
1977 	Human Social Groups: A cybernetic account of  stability and instability PhD Thesis. Brunel University.

and later in book form (now sadly out of print... but I still have some copies if anyone wants one)

1984	Groups  John Wiley. Chichester and New York

BODY:
<p>I spent most of last week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Like last year, I found little that excited me. I overheard from a convention staffer that they had 30% more attendees, so the conference is growing again, but my week there also reinforced my opinions regarding the industry as a whole as I describe in my previous blog posting <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html">The Bad Business of Fear</a>.</p>

<p>I asked a number of random people what they thought of the conference. Some agreed with me, saying that they were troubled by the lack of innovation. Others said that they actually liked it -- it showed that the industry was being run by businessmen finally, and not by geeks. Others said that it was just the inevitable maturation of an industry. Tim Oren wrote in his blog <a href="http://www.pacificavc.com/blog/2004/02/27.html#a565">Due Diligence</a>:<blockquote>Every year the show is less about cryptography per se. I'm sure this has something to do with RSA's attempts to diversify as its patents expire, but I do think it reflects the state of the field. Crypto has become a standardized component of security solutions, and the biggest perceived threats are not in the privacy area.</blockquote></p>

<p>The hilight of the conference to me was hearing respected cryptographer Whitfield Diffie say to me that he had read my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/security_crypto.html">The Bad Business of Fear</a> and that he liked it. Apparently it had been sent to him by someone at Sun who had thought that it was saying many of the things that Diffie has been saying as well. Diffie said that he had some specific criticisms, so I hope that he'll comment here someday on them.</p>

<p><br />
<h4>Caller-ID for Email</h4></p>

<p>The big announcement of the week was that Microsoft will be be releasing their own spam solution, a <a href="http://windows-help.net/cgi-bin/2004/7.08.cgi?70801">Caller ID</a> for email addresses, starting this summer in HotMail and in their mail servers. Basically the way this works is that every domain holder publishes inside their DNS records the IP addresses of any valid outbound email server. This information is stored using XML in a special signed format. After a mail is sent, the receiving system queries the DNS to confirm that the outbound server is not being spoofed.</p>

<p>This is a very similar technique to what a number of other companies are proposing, for instance AOL is backing a proposal called <a href="http://spf.pobox.com/execsumm.html">SPF (Sender Policy Framework)</a> or sometimes "Sender Permitted From", and Yahoo is backing <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,4149,1430976,00.asp">Domain Keys</a>. Unfortunately, Microsoft's Caller-ID proposal requires XML, which makes implementation much more complicated. It requires the entire email to be received by the server first, before looking up the DNS record, then validating a signature -- all of which introduces more burdens on the mail server. Lastly, this XML may exceed the 512-character limit for DNS requests, which can cause DNS servers to send via TCP rather then UDP, which may introduces even more uncertainty.</p>

<p>It is good to see that Microsoft, AOL and Yahoo are taking spam seriously, but I do worry that that the burden of supporting more then one of these standards may be significant. This could mean that only large corporations, educational institutions, and ISPs could host email, whereas small companies, third-world organizations, and individuals could not. I would prefer that one solution be broadly and easily adopted. <font color=red><s>Daniel Goldman</s></font> <font color=green>Yakov Shafranovich</font> in <a href="http://www.shaftek.org/blog/archives/000061.html">NetWizard's blog</a> is also concerned about patent claims and lack of IETF participation:<blockquote>At the same time none of these proposals have been submitted to any standards bodies such as the <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org">IETF</A>, and as a matter of fact <A HREF="https://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/asrg/current/msg09082.html">Microsoft was invited</A> to submit "Caller ID" and participate in <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/ietf/04mar/marid.txt">this week's meeting at the IETF on the subject</A>, but <A HREF="http://www.imc.org/ietf-mxcomp/mail-archive/msg00023.html">they declined</A>. At the same time the community had jumped on Caller ID's patent license by declaring a (and <A HREF="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/02/26/1448253&mode=thread">a possible incompatibility with the GPL</A>). Of course it remains to be seen what exactly does Caller ID claim to patent since RMX and other prior art existed at least since 1998, and if Caller ID ever makes it to the IETF, Microsoft will have to deal with <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3669.txt">the new IPR guidelines (RFC 3669)</A> which favor non-patented technologies.</blockquote>I'm also not convinced that even if these techniques are deployed (Gartner group <a href="http://informationweek.securitypipeline.com/news/18201583">predicts</a> less then 25% will implement these in the next two years) that they will not return us to early 1990's levels of spam, only just slow down the onslaught. For instance, in a similar fashion to current WiFi war-chalking, a spammer could wait until an authenticated user logged in a mail server and hijack that connection. Unless the link is encrypted and authenticated, it is possible for a spammer to impersonate the legitimate user without anyone being the wiser. Related, these techniques do not necessarily help with the growing threat of "phishing" -- emails that lure unsuspecting users to enter credit card or bank account information into fake web sites.</p>

<p>I am also concerned that all of these standards require some measure of public-key infrastructure, including management of public-keys, which many security analysts believe that we are not doing a good enough job now.</p>

<p>There is some good thoughtful analysis of these three standards by Larry Seltzer of eWeek in <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,1761,a=120536,00.asp">Who will Win the SMTP Authentication Wars</a>.</p>

<p><br />
<h4>More Security in Windows XP SP2</h4></p>

<p>Bill Gates also discussed new security features in the upcoming Windows XP SP2. In addition to some interesting "Active Protection Technology" to prevent overflow attacks, he discussed built-in virus protection and an improved built-in firewall that also warns of outbound connections.</p>

<p>Out in the hall I heard some people saying that announcement was a good basis for selling Symantec short, while others countered that Microsoft never gets these type of things right and there would always be business for Symantec. Companies that offer more minor features like preventing browser popups will be hurt. However, as these solutions are already free and ubiquitous, this is one of the few cases where I prefer for these to be in the default Microsoft install. However, I do worry for the smaller but more innovative security vendors like ZoneAlarm.</p>

<p><br />
<h4>Sessions</h4></p>

<p>Over the years the sessions at RSA have become more managerial and corporate in nature, but there were a couple of good technical sessions that I attended or friends commented on.</p>

<p>I was pleased by the Cryptographer's Panel response to Bill Gates' announcements: "We have a lot of great levers in cryptography, but we're missing the OSes and platforms that can really serve our keys," said Ronald Rivest. "Bill Gates didn't talk about simplifying things, but that's the only way we are going to get security. We're not smart enough to handle the complexity of this stuff. You have to get the complexity out of there," continued Paul Kocher. Whitfield Diffie criticized security the upcoming Windows Longhorn release because "For the first time, you will have a PC that does NOT do what you tell it to." </p>

<p>The Cryptographer's Panel also spoke on the topic of electronic voting, and supported calls for paper ballots to supplement and verify votes cast with new electronic voting technology. Rivest cautioned "We know only too well the difficulties of securing complex electronic systems."</p>

<p>I also heard good things about the "Hacking VM Machines" and "Analyzing Topologies of Trust" sessions, and the closing keynote by PJ O'Rouke, but I missed them -- anyone have any notes? Where there some other good sessions I missed?</p>

<p><br />
<h4>Exhibits</h4></p>

<p>The exhibit floor was again a bit droll for me.  Like in previous years the floor was dominated by vendors selling rather high-end corporate systems that might have excited me more if I was in the market for one, but I was looking for less expensive systems for smaller businesses. Like last year there were lots of dedicated devices, such as firewalls, spam prevention, VPN and intrusion detection hardware, and fewer companies offering software to use with my existing hardware.</p>

<p>I did like some of the biometric hard drives, but investigating more deeply I just can't trust them yet. No one yet offers a good solution for redundant key storage yet for these, as a backup in case of a physical failure.</p>

<p>I did see one company <a href="http://www.authenex.com">Authenex</a> that was offering free USB keys that supposedly allow you to encrypt files on your system and email them to someone else with a different key -- it looks like some public key technique is being used, with the key serving as a pre-generated private key storage. More interestingly, they claim that if you register your USB key at their website, they can send you a replacement key that you can use to decrypt your old files. I'll have to do some more investigation of the technology behind this, and if they've had adequate study by cryptographers that I trust. If they have, and they start offering storage on those keys as well, they may have something useful that I'll buy.</p>

<p>RSA had an demo of it's <a href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/company/news/releases/pr.asp?doc_id=3376">prototype RFID blocker tag</a> that they suggest is a possible solution to some of the fears that some of us privacy advocates have been worrying about. <a href="http://scottmace.typepad.com/imanager/2004/02/cool_demo_rsa_r.html">Scott Mace</a> has a good description of the demo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Each booth visitor selects from one of three demo prescriptions -- "tranquility pills," "wisdom pills," or "happiness pills." (I chose wisdom, naturally.) The RSA Labs crew requests a name from the visitor, then hands over an appropriately-tagged bottle (mine contained jellybeans). They scan the bottle on an RFID tabletop scanner and visitors see the details of the prescription, including type of prescription and patient's name. Then, they insert the bottle into an ordinary paper pharmacy bag that happens to contain a paper "blocker tag" that then blocks any attempt for an RFID reader to scan the bottle while it's in the bag.</p></blockquote><p>
Though a cool demo, I'm not as confident that this solution will work. Now in addition to the previous "foil bag" theft techniques, what prevents someone from building one of these into a watch or a PDA? Sending a signal to burn-out the RFID is one of the other proposals out there, it has similar problems -- what if someone goes into a WalMart and burns-out every RFID in the place?

<p>RSA was also demoing its latest SecurID integration with Windows, which will extend the life of this security token for RSA customers for many years. I spoke to Scott Schnell, VP of Marketing, afterwards at a party and he explained to me some of the details of how they made it work with Windows laptops. Apparently the system will cache up to several weeks worth of SecurID information such that the laptop owner can use his SecurID token to log on to his laptop even though he is not connected to the network. I neat trick, though I'd like to see some more security reviews before I'd deploy it broadly.</p>

<p>Probably the most interesting, but least useful to me, was a booth for <a href="http://www.magiqtech.com/">Magiq Technology</a>, who offer a commercial quantum cryptography solution. Quantum cryptography is the ultimate in secret key exchange at a distance -- you can sort of say that the universe protects you from snoopers. However, you have to have a fiber-optic connection between the two devices, which limits its practicality. But it is still cool.</p>

EXCERPT:
I spent most of last week at the RSA Conference in San Francisco. Like last year, I found little that excited me. I overheard from a convention staffer that they had 30% more attendees, so the conference is growing again, but my week there also reinforced my opinions regarding the industry as a whole as I describe in my previous blog posting. (Blog entry continues with comments on caller-id for email, more security in Windows XP, sessions, and exhibits)

BODY:
<p>As I head out next week to the <a href="http://2004.rsaconference.com/">RSA Conference</a> I realized that it has been 13 years since I attended the first one. I remember fondly the potential and power of cryptography technology in 1991 -- public keys, digital certificates, new possibilities for privacy, digital cash, etc.</p>

<p>After 8 more years I left the compujter security industry on March 15, 1999. The computer security industry also seemed to be filled with as much potential as it did back in 1991. Amazon, EBay, and other Internet notables were still riding high, and driving before them the need for secure Internet transactions. The government's attempt to cripple the industry through their Clipper chip initiative was all but dead, and we were slowly winning the rights to export our technologies without severe and unnecessary government restrictions. We were beginning to truly see how Certificate Authorities worked in practical usage, and were coming up with plans for smaller, more efficient certs, to help bring security to wireless devices and set-top boxes.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I left the industry at such a height, but I'd accomplished my own personal goals. I helped midwife the startup of <a href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a>, and digital certificates were now broadly available for both servers and clients. I'd helped fight Clipper, and freed RSAREF so that it could be used by Open Source software before the expiration of the patent. I'd grown Consensus Development, a company I founded almost a decade before, from a small engineering house into the premiere SSL developer. I'd lead the team that developed the SSL Reference version for Netscape, and had completed the IETF's <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt">RFC 2246</a> that described the future of SSL called TLS.</p>

<p>Thus I found myself at the heart of a burgeoning Internet commerce industry. When <a href="http://www.certicom.com">Certicom</a>, a leading cryptography company, had expressed a desire to purchase my company, I considered the returns for my investors, the value to my employees -- I was pleased with the results, and agreed. So I made an exit from the security industry, and as part of my agreement with Certicom I signed a non-compete which gave them a few years' head start before I dipped my foot back into the security industry. </p>

<p>Now, five years more have gone by. My non-compete with Certicom has expired and for over a year I have slowly been easing my way back into the world of security and cryptography. I must admit, I was a bit uncertain at first. Five years ago I had seen the industry perched on the edge of the next big change. It had been prepared to secure the hundreds of new applications that were proliferating on the net; to broadly adopt TLS, the newest version of SSL; to really look at the practical applications of certificate authorities and recreate the entire concept as a second generation of ideas. I wondered how far behind I would be, if I'd recognize the industry at all. Internet time had still been moving fast back in 1999 and I wasn't sure how many generations had gone by in the security industry. One, two, more?</p>

<p>So last year I started attending security related conferences again, such as <a href="http://www.ietf.org/meetings/meetings.html">IETF Meetings</a>, the <a href="http://2004.rsaconference.com/">RSA Conference</a>, and others. I was ready to come as a student, to soak up the new knowledge imparted in the talks and tutorials, to glory in the changes that the last five years had brought. Instead I discovered, almost nothing had changed. If anything, the industry had been moving backward, just a tiny bit. </p>

<p>What had happened to an industry that just five years ago had been rapidly pushing forward the frontiers of technology? </p>

<p>And, more important, how could it move forward? </p>

<h4>The State of the Industry: Living off of Fear</h4>

<p>Overall, I find the state of the security industry to be a bit sobering for its lack of momentum in recent years. This slowdown can be seen nowhere as easily as upon the exhibit floor of RSA Conference, the premiere conference for this industry, which I attended last year and will attend again next week.</p>

<p>Walking the floors of RSA last year, in the immense exhibit hall at the San Jose Convention Center, I did feel a sense of energy. The floor was still packed, and the carefully cut kiosks and the garish banners bespoke the millions put into the show by the exhibitors. The constant chatter was a deafening white noise, and whenever I veered too near a booth, there was a salesman very eager to tell me about his company's latest and greatest. </p>

<p>But, to a certain extent, that energy felt to me like a facade. There was nothing new; instead all the exhibitors were showing off the same technology that they were displaying five years ago. There was a bit of glitz and some extra chrome, perhaps a carefully redesigned product name, but beyond that there was a weird feeling of deja vu. </p>

<p>There were the same old tools that we've been using to deter hackers since the advent of the Morris Worm way back in 1989: products to detect intruders and safeguard your machines against them; firewalls; and VPNs. Maybe we've gotten a little better at figuring out expert rules, maybe we've improved our user interfaces, but these are slow, gradual upgrades, not quantum leaps.</p>

<p>Email still seems to be the newest battlefield upon which security wars are being fought, and you could find any number of new anti-spam tools at RSA. The Bayesian filters are a new and interesting way to statistically classify spam, but at the core level they're a dynamic outgrowth of keyboard filters that have been around for as long as we've been fighting unsolicited commercial email. RSA's big release of the year, Nightingale, was simply another way to protect sensitive online information, a competitor to Microsoft's Wallet technology. We had the ubiquitous hardware tokens too, and discussion of the recently approved AES encryption standard, but nothing dramatically new and exciting. </p>

<p>I suppose I shouldn't have been too surprised, based on my experiences at IETF a month before. Most of the Security Area working groups were still working on the same problems that they'd been discussing five years before. S/MIME is pushing forward on yet another draft of a standard that has never been broadly deployed. IPSEC is similarly continuing to work on the same problems, now years old. TLS was widely implemented and specified, but not widely adopted -- the world still uses SSL 3.0.</p>

<p>In the last year since those two conferences I had lunch with various professional colleagues that I had lost track of, continued to watch as a bystander the leading edge of security and cryptography.</p>

<p>As I overview the industry I have begun to feel that we'd largely abandoned the most interesting and innovative security techniques that were being discussed just five years ago. What happened to alternative public key infrastructures? What happened to attribute or role certificates? What happened to "authorization" being the next step after "authentication", or separating "security" from "privacy"?</p>

<p>Remarkably, if any of these topics are being considered, they seem to be moving outside of the traditional security industry. Such is the case with <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security">SAML, the Security Assertion Markup Language</a>, a branch of XML which seems to be doing some of the only work on attribute certificates.</p>

<p>With so many technologies abandoned utterly, or else given up to another computer fields, we must ask: why are we stagnating, moving backward rather than forward? </p>

<h4>Fear: Outlining the Problem</h4>

<p>I thought, could it be the result of the dot-bomb and subsequent recession? Perhaps that is part of it, but we are in denial unless we face the deeper cause. If we go on as we are the security industry will not recover with the next boom.</p>

<p>The decline of the security industry is based upon a basic disconnect between the business world and the security world. </p>

<p>Within the security industry we base our models of trust upon mathematics. We strive to continually push the envelope by codifying security and improving it. On the other hand the business industry bases its models of trust upon risk. It balances the risk of a bad outcome, the cost of that bad outcome, and the cost of reducing that risk. Even if a system is technically insecure, the business world will accept it if the risk of a security breach is low, the cost of a security breach is low, or the cost of closing that breach is high. </p>

<p>Where our model is mathematics, theirs is economics. These two models worked well in tandem for quite a few years; the need for a security industry was initially obvious because of the totally undefined risks and the potentially high costs that were out there, waiting to be taken advantage of.</p>

<p>But now, years later, we've done our job too well. We've taken all those undefined risks and codified them -- made them real and quantifiable. We've offered real demonstrations of online security through years of ecommerce, and in doing so we've proven lower rates of credit card fraud, and almost total proof from high-cost offline problems like extortion and bad reputation. We've helped fill out business' risk models and so shown when we were necessary and when weren't. </p>

<p>In short, we have dug ourselves into a hole. Thus it shouldn't be surprising that the newer security technologies are stagnating ... because we've carefully, cleverly, and constantly diminished our revenues by staying with a business model in which 'good enough' security will become ever cheaper. We've turned our security business into a cheaper alternative to insurance, where business only pay for security if their insurance premiums would otherwise be too high. As the bulk of the risk is now handled by old, cheap technology, what remains for new sales is not enough to keep us truly innovating.</p>

<p>Recent statistics underline the decreasing value of innovative, new security to businesses. According to the <a href="http://www.gocsi.com/press/20030528.jhtml?_requestid=105732">CSI/FBI 2003 Computer Crime and Security Survey</a>, the annual cost of computer crime has decreased in almost every category. From 2001 to 2003, the cost for theft of proprietary information is down from $151.2M to $70.2M. System penetration by outsiders is down from $19.1M to $2.8M. Insider abuse of network access is down from $35.0M to $11.8M. The only computer crime up in dollar damage inflicted is denial-of-service attacks, a very small part of the security pie. </p>

<p>With costs due to computer crime plunging year after year, clearly companies are not incentivized to put money in new prevention technologies.</p>

<p>To simplify, as long as the risks were unknown, we were in a business feeding off of 'fear' and our security industry 'pie' was growing. But as we and our customers both understand the risks better, and as we get better at mitigating those risks cheaply, this "fear" shrinks and thus the entire 'pie' of the security industry becomes smaller. Yes, new 'threats' keep on coming: denial-of-service, worms, spam, etc., but businesses understanding of past risks make them believe that these new risks can be solved and commodified in the same way.</p>

<p>As the philosophy and culture of the business world is hundreds of years old, going back to at least the Italian merchants of the Renaissance, business isn't going to change its model of how business works. Thus, it is up to us to rework the basic beliefs and understanding of our security industry.</p>

<p>In order to get out of this hole we need to dramatically rethink how we approach, develop, and market security services. To do this requires us to reconsider our own security models, based upon a better understanding of core business models. Some possibilities: </p>

<ol><li><a href="#insurance">Enter the Insurance Business</a></li>
<li><a href="#reliabiliy">Move into Reliability Improvement</a></li>
<li><a href="#enabling">Move into Enabling Technologies</a></li></ol>

<h4><a name="insurance">Solution #1: Entering the Insurance Business</a></h4>

<p>Entering the insurance business is an old idea. It was once an important part of <a href="http://www.verisign.com">Verisign's</a> business plan, and no doubt of others as well.</p>

<p>At its simplest level, we can enter the insurance business by offering a guarantee against damages with a product. The main benefit of this approach is that it lets us approach security in a more rational and realistic fashion. No longer do we have to engage in an endless quest for improved security, no matter how small the risk. Instead we can assess our risks and prepare ourselves to accept manageable losses. </p>

<p>There are risks implicit in this solution as well. For the most part, those of us in the security industry are unfamiliar with the insurance business model, and thus we're entering particularly uncharted waters. In addition, we need to understand that some losses will be huge and unavoidable, such as was the case with the Code Red worm. We thus need to create business models that are acceptable to our customers, but which do not leave us entirely liable for the next utterly unforeseen worm which gets set loose on the Internet. </p>

<p>There may also be some limitations with this particular model, if the valuations of security companies are too low to insure the losses of a large corporation, such as a GM. </p>

<p>Finally, we need to ask ourselves the question: "What value does insured security provide over simple insurance?" I suspect there are some real values to customers in saved productivity and time, but further market research would be required to truly assess this. </p>

<p>A security company could offset most of these risks by a partnership with an insurance company or another business within the insurance industry. We would need deep reserves and to work together with imaginative actuaries. Together we could offer insurance against the damages of security breaches. We would be the guardians against break-ins and the fixers if they did occur. The insurance company would help estimate risks, collect premiums and pay. </p>

<p>If we chose to go it alone, we could offer risk mitigation services to insurance companies. We would guard and provide disaster mitigation services for a monthly premium. For example, when offering an anti-breakin security system, we could offer a guarantee to rebuild all certified systems if an intrusion does occur. This way we would take some, but not all, of the risks. Perhaps our presence would reduce insurance premiums enough to pay for our fees. </p>

<p>Overall, despite potential risks, I believe that using an insurance model is a strong possibility for the security industry. </p>

<h4><a name="reliability">Solution #2: Improving Reliability</a></h4> 

<p>Some of us in the security business may feel like we are already providing reliability, because many of our products prevent catastrophic risks due to break-in, theft, and other malevolent acts. However, what we generally tend to offer is data security, not data reliability. Perhaps paradoxically, at the more personal, day-to-day level, the security industry has actually reduced data reliability in the name of improved data security. </p>

<p>I can personally testify to this fact because I have, recently, lost data due to security. I encrypted a directory in Windows XP, then was later forced to rebuild my system. Apparently some of the required info to decrypt the directory was stored in some unrecoverable registry entry, because I can no longer access it. The data is totally secure, but also unavailable. </p>

<p>This anecdote isn't unusual for the security industry. Forgotten keys can often cause cryptographic-related data loss. Likewise, VPNs and firewalls introduce single points of failure into networks. </p>

<p>RSA's Nightingale technology of last year is a fairly standard security-based technology. It uses "secret-splitting" technology to divide sensitive data among two different locations, thus removing what RSA calls "a single point of compromise"; you can't get access to the data unless you compromise two machines. Clearly, there is improved data security. However it raises the same old problem of data reliability, because now data can be lost if either of two servers is lost. </p>

<p>Improving reliability of extant security protocols is a good move forward in this expansion of the industry. For example in a classic cryptography situation we might unlock data with multiple secrets, but only require a set number of those secrets to unlock the data, not all of them.</p>

<p>Consider a company who is encrypting some of their most sensitive sales and marketing data. Ten company officers might each possess a secret which together can be used to decrypt all the data. However, this introduces a clear reliability problem, as the departure of any officer could leave all sales and marketing data unreadable. (Likewise, just restricting this data access to one specific secret, such as that of the VP of Sales, introduces this single-point-of-failure condition.) Instead we could offer a high reliability, but secure situation where any five (of ten) secrets together could decrypt the data. Therefore, if an individual officer disappears, leaves for a rival company, or otherwise makes his secret unavailable, not only can he himself not access the data alone, but even if he leaves with the secret the remainder of the company's access is unaffected. And, if a company didn't think that "5 of 10" executive was the right number, they could instead only require "3 of 10" to decrypt the data ... or "7" or "9".</p>

<p>By thinking in this new methodology, by measuring security against reliability, we can offer our customers real choices and let them each choose the level of security that works best for them. </p>

<p>However, the underlying bases of cryptography let us go a step further than this. Even without considering security implications, we can make use of our existing cryptographic algorithms in order to allow for more reliable access to and retrieval of all sorts of data. In other words, we can offer protection against not just hackers, but also backup errors, system crashes, and other catastrophic failures that are actually much more likely to affect the average user than an Internet security breach is. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ips-charter.html">iSCSI</a>, a remote SCSI protocol, offers very good potential for interaction with cryptography. A redundancy caching technique, somewhat like RAID 5, could be integrated with a secret share system where, e.g., the data could be read as long as 80% of the remote drives (and thus their keys) could be accessed; this allows for a very high reliability storage system because individual storage drives could be distantly located, and at the same time uses cryptographic techniques to offset reliability problems that could potentially be caused by the uncertain and fluid nature of Internet connectivity. </p>

<p>Even issues like load balancing and methods to deal with machine down-time might all be improved by some of our cryptographic techniques.</p>

<h4><a name="enabling">Solution #3: Leaving Behind Fear</a></h4>

<p>In talking about insurance and reliability I feel like I'm largely expanding upon a fairly well-known and conservative way of using cryptography. These are good first steps for companies that wish to move forward in a cryptography market that is shrinking due to our own success, but they're not necessarily enough for a major breakout into revenue sources that will make this once again an exciting industry from a business point of view.</p>

<p>What is required, I believe, is a major paradigm shift. We need to leave the whole business of fear behind and instead embrace a new model: using cryptography to enable business rather than to prevent harm. We need to add value by making it possible to do profitable business in ways that are impossible today. There are, fortunately, many cryptographic opportunities, if we only consider them. </p>

<p>Cryptography can be used to make business processes faster and more efficient. With tools derived from cryptography, executives can delegate more efficiently and introduce better checks and balances. They can implement improved decision systems. Entrepreneurs can create improved auction systems. Nick Szabo is one of the few developers who has really investigated this area, through his work on <a href="http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_9/szabo/">Smart Contracts</a>. He has suggested ways to create digital bearer certificates, and has contemplated some interesting secure auctioning techniques and even digital liens. Expanding upon his possibilities we can view the ultimate Smart Contract as a sort of Smart Property. Why not form a corporation on the fly with digital stock certificates, allow it to engage in its creative work, then pay out its investors and workers and dissolve? With new security paradigms, this is all possible. </p>

<p>Federated identity is another area for potential expansion. Secure, federated identities could offer many benefits for consumers. Imagine being able to visit a third-party seller on the Internet, automatically charge a sale to your Amazon account, then automatically ship it to your standard address, all through a single secured identity token. Federated network identity also has real applicability in the business world, as is shown by the work being done by <a href="http://www.projectliberty.org/">Liberty Alliance</a>. Through a business system like this, an auto parts manufacturer could offer his products to General Motors as part of a larger bid, all without having to specifically arrange identity with GM itself. </p>

<p>However, there are notable challenges in the area of federated identity -- challenges which a new-paradigm security industry could lead the way in solving. Distinctions must be made regarding various levels of identity security, so that, e.g., your VPN couldn't be accessed if someone gained access to your Amazon password. In addition there are real concerns from users about controlling their user information, due to worries over spam and privacy; some users, for examples, might not want information about their politics, sexuality, or interests federated with information about their family or job. For instance do we really want our information on <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> to be used by <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>?. These challenges demonstrate why federated identity is still a leading edge possibility for the security industry.</p>

<p>Beyond business processes and federated identity there are many other areas that the security industry should be considering, as it moves beyond the business of fear. The whole idea of Public Key Infrastructures should perhaps be rethought, and maybe we should resuscitate lost technologies such as Attribute Certificates, and some of the ideas such as local name spaces as in described Rivest's <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/sdsi.html">SDSI</a>. There are also some interesting possibilities for trusted peer-to-peer environments that can be dynamically expanded on the fly. The possibilities are only limited by our imagination, if we can just think beyond current possibilities.</p>

<p>We have already seen the first wave of security technology; now we need to initiate a second, for I believe with the next wave the best is yet to come.

Just thought I would comment that  in building actuarial tables, insurance companies have a relatively small set of policy-holder behaviors and traits. Auto insurance underwriters look at  age, vehicle model and model year, zip code, driving history, and maybe a few more traits. How do you even start to build a table for the computer industry? You're running Windows? Fine, double your premiums. You're running Windows 95? Great, double them again. You haven't updated your router firmware in three months? Well... what does that do the measure of risk? Anything?

I've always really liked the idea of IT insurance as a way to drive effective, practical security protections, but  I think we're light-years away from collecting enough information to build a reliable actuarial table.

I enjoyed this article.

The RSA expo floor really makes me feel sad nowadays.  It has really driven home the lesson that security is not, as I once believed, a tool that naturally lends itself to increasing freedom.  Instead, like all tools, it cuts either way depending on the hand that guides it.

I remain hopeful that capability access control will be deployed and will enable, in Mark Miller's phrase, "cooperation without vulnerability".  The concept of mutually untrusting code (operating on behalf of mutually untrusting people) cooperating in a single address space is a paradigm that the MUD culture has been practicing for at least a decade and that the Java culture is likely to discover in 2004.

The increasing importance of virtualization, Trusted/Treacherous Computing, and the like also lead us closer to this paradigm.

BODY:
<p>While at <a href="http://etech.weblogsinc.com/">eTech</a>, I attended a number of "social software" sessions. One thing I heard was a persistent call from folk like <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/">Marc Canter</a> for all the vendors to support something called <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF</a>. FOAF is a standard for "Friend of a Friend" files, and is an attempt to make <em>machine readable</em> information about people, groups, companies, and other online resources. In particular, it is focused on representing the information that you might typically put on your personal home page in a form such that meta-data tools can interpret it.</p>

<p>If you are using the blog service <a href="http://www.typepad.com">TypePad</a> or the social networking service <a href="http://www.ecademy.com">Ecademy</a> you may already have a FOAF file without knowing it, and <a href="http://www.tribe.net">Tribe.Net</a> announced at eTech that they were promising to support it as well for their social networking service.</p>

<p>FOAF as a standard is still in a fairly primitive state -- to me it feels like HTML did during the days of the early Mosaic browser, when every good web page had to be hand-crafted in a text editor and uploaded to a server. However, like HTML, it may have great promise.</p>

<p>The first thing that FOAF may offer us is a way to exchange information between various social networking services. For instance, I just exported all my <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> friends into my own FOAF file by hand, but there are those who are working on tools to do this automatically, and once Tribe offers FOAF, services like Orkut may be forced to do the same.</p>

<p>Probably more important in the long run is that FOAF may decentralize the data that you make public about yourself -- to put the data under your own control. Owned by you rather then owned by the services you use. For instance, many people have <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/35375.html">complained about Orkut's ownership of information</a>.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with FOAF right now is that it doesn't support very much "progressive disclosure" or privacy. Progressive disclosure is how people typically handle private information -- they disclose information about themselves a bit at a time, and as trust builds, offer more. The only small measure of privacy that FOAF has is that it has a way to obscure email addresses so that they can't easily be harvested by spammers. But all your other information is totally public. Theoretically you can <a href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/encryptingFoafFiles">encrypt your FOAF</a> file, but this method requires external PGP-based encrypted files. There is also the possibility of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">XML-DSIG</a>, however, I find this standard to also be extremely cumbersome right now. <a href="http://www.plaxo.com">Plaxo</a> is a major social networking service that has some excellent <a href="http://blog.plaxo.com/archives/000007.html">comments on FOAF privacy</a> and other issues.</p>

<p>What I want is something that allows people to make 'local' assertions about themselves and their friends, and be able to have those friends be able to 'discover' more information by using those assertions. Ron Rivest came out with an interesting method for this in an old project called <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sdsi10.html">SDSI - A Simple Distributed Security Infrastructure</a> that I hope will inspire a few FOAF architects someday. To adopt his method for FOAF requires everyone to have a FOAF service script somewhere and not just a data file. But we've seen broad adoption of personal RSS and Trackback services, so I don't think this is a huge obstacle to overcome.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to play around with FOAF take over control of your own public data, I've included detailed information on how to get started in hand-crafting your own FOAF file.</p>

<h4>Hand-Crafting your own FOAF</h4>

<p>First, start with <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">FOAF-a-Matic</a>. This is a web form page that will create a very simple starting FOAF file for you. Don't put any information in it that you don't want to be public, and skip the section on "people you know". When it asks for your email address, make sure to enter it in all lower-case. When completed, it will look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;rdf:RDF
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
  xmlns:rdfs="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#"
  xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">
  &lt;foaf:Person>
    &lt;foaf:name>Christopher Allen&lt;/foaf:name>
    &lt;foaf:title>Mr&lt;/foaf:title>
    &lt;foaf:firstName>Christopher&lt;/foaf:firstName>
    &lt;foaf:surname>Allen&lt;/foaf:surname>
    &lt;foaf:nick>Chris&lt;/foaf:nick>
    &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum>9ee1c03552f22e89592ce583be0ab8db0c4f2c59&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
    &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/>
    &lt;foaf:depiction
      rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/images/ChristopherAllen(100x100).gif"/>
    &lt;foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com"/>
    &lt;foaf:workInfoHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.alacrityventures.com/allen.html"/>
  &lt;/foaf:Person>
&lt;/rdf:RDF></pre></blockquote>
<p>The next thing is to add pointers to any other FOAF files that you might have on other services, for instance, I have a profile on Marc Canter's <a href="http://peopleaggregator.com/">People Aggregator</a> service. You should also list the place where you plan on making your FOAF file available -- you might think that this is a circular reference, but it is OK. My convention is to put the most "authoritative" FOAF file last, so that if there is a conflict the last one might override earlier ones. However, in practice I've not found that any FOAF tool I've used supports this convention. Put these right above the closing <code>&lt;/foaf:Person><code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=102" />
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://www.ecademy.com/module.php?mod=network&amp;amp;op=foafrdf&amp;amp;uid=42230" />
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf" />
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now upload your file to your own web site, and then run your FOAF file through two different validators, the first being the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/">W3C RDF Validation Service</a>. It will tell you if you've made any mistakes with the RDF aspect of the file. Then use <a href="http://sw1.ilrt.org/discovery/2003/08/validation/">Rosco</a> which will also look at your schema and make recommendations as to missing items. Unfortunately, neither validator is very good at telling you what the problem is if it finds one -- again, it is like the old hand-coding HTML days when you are debugging your web pages.</p>

<p>Once you've got your basic FOAF file working, now to enter your friends. First, add to your <code>foaf:Person</code> the following:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:knows rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter"/>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This is a pointer that says "look in this document for a person with the <code>rdf:nodeID</code> of MarcCanter". You can invent any value you want for this ID, mcanter, mark, canter, etc., however, it must be a unique ID on this page.</p>

<p>Then fill out the following template for each person, putting below your own <code>foaf:Person</code> but above the closing <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="">
  &lt;foaf:name>&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:firstname>&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:surname>&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:nick>&lt;/foaf:nick>
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum>&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="" />
&lt;/foaf:Person>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>So for instance with Marc Canter:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="MarcCanter">
  &lt;foaf:name>Marc Canter&lt;/foaf:name>
  &lt;foaf:mbox_sha1sum>41e872618d70ba18a7af715083f522afe7fc3238&lt;/foaf:mbox_sha1sum>
  &lt;rdfs:seeAlso rdf:resource="http://peopleaggregator.com/profile?id=4" />
&lt;/foaf:Person>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now <code>foaf:firstname</code>, <code>foaf:surname</code>, and <code>foaf:nick</code> are not absolutely essential -- you can remove them if they are not needed. I tend to only use them when there might be some confusion, for instance, for "Arthur De Boies" has "De Boise" is a surname, and "Lori Ann Miller" has "Lori Ann" as a firstname. <code>foaf:nick</code> is useful in situatations where there is a dimunitive involved, for instance "Christopher Allen" has "Chris" as a nick, and <code>foaf:nick</code> is also used by some programs online personas or for IRC chat, such as "ChristopherA".</p>

<p>Now where did the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> come from? The purpose of this number is to obscure the email address so that it can't be harvested by spammers, yet is unique enough that it can FOAF-based applications can find people. To convert an email address to a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> you can use <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/">sha1ify</a>. Just enter the email address that you want converted in all lower case, and copy the string it generates to the <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, you can search and see if any existing FOAF profiles exist for your friend at <a href="http://eikeon.com/foaf/">FOAF: Web View</a>, using their email address. If the friend does have a FOAF file, add it to <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> tag.</p>

<p>When you are done, test your FOAF file with the two validators, and if it works. One common problem that the validators will fail to give you a good error message about is if any of the URLs you use contain any improper characters like &amp; - in particular, Ecademy's FOAF files use this character. Just substitute &amp;amp; for every occurrence of &amp; and it should work fine. Another problem is if any of your friends have international characters in their names, for instance "Sébastien". To avoid this problem, put the following at the top of your FOAF file above your <code>rdf:RDF</code> tag.</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Once everything is working you can submit it to services like <a href="http://eikeon.com/foaf/">FOAF: Web View</a>. You can also browse your FOAF file directly by using <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/">FOAF Explorer</a>, or import it into services like <a href="http://peopleaggregator.com">People Aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>Once your FOAF file is working and submitted, you'll want to add an "auto-discovery" meta-tag to your blog or home page. This is placed in the <code>head</code> portion of your HTML code:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml"
  title="FOAF" href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf"/>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you are using TypePad, it forces you to use their FOAF file for you unless you used an Advanced Template. With an Advanced Template you can remove the following tags and replace it with the above:</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;MTUserIfShow field="foaf">
  &lt;link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="FOAF" href="&lt;$MTUserSiteURL$>foaf.rdf" />
  &lt;/MTUserIfShow>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>From this point on it is just a matter of looking at other people's FOAF files and seeing if you want to add any of the other profile properties that they use. I'm trying to keep a well documented foaf at <a href="http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf">http://web.lifewithalacrity.com/christophera/foaf.rdf</a>, and I also recommend looking at Morten Frederiksen's FOAF at <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf">http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/morten.rdf</a> which supports far more profile information then my FOAF does.</p>

<p>Also useful is the IRC chat channel at irc.freenode.net #foaf -- I got a lot of useful tips and advice there.</p>

On the encryption issue: FOAFbot supports encrypted FOAF files (per the link), and I've just set up a service for hosting these types of files, so you don't have to encrypt them yourself: <a href="http://foaf.dk/hosting/">http://foaf.dk/hosting/</a>
Of course, that means you have to trust me...

On the ordering of seeAlso: RDF/XML doesn't have a sense of order (unless you use rdf:Seq, as in RSS). In short, you're simply making statements of fact (hopefully!), statements that could stand on their own. There's no default or primary.

<p>A fascinating series of blog entries shows the promise and peril of social software and Blogs as a medium in a male-dominated technocracy:</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.misbehaving.net/2004/02/sexist_jokes_an.html">misbehaving.net: "sexist jokes and Orkut invites"</a>, Dana Boyd writes:<blockquote>When i received this note, i simultaneously recognized the intended joke and felt the shudder of being so blatantly seen as an object.</blockquote>At <a href="http://radiofreeblogistan.com/2004/02/04/this_social_software_stuff_is_tricky.html">Radio Free Blogistan: "This social software stuff is tricky"</a> Christian Crumlish apologizes:<blockquote>In my mind, I was cracking on the phenomenon of me being linked to so many other men. I wasn't sure if this had something to do with the population of Orkut or with my own subnetwork there.</p>

<p>However, by using language that divided up men and women in terms of visual appeal or attractiveness, I totally slipped over the line. What might be taken as irreverant and ironic by my "real" friends, who are probably somewhat likely to give me the benefit of the doubt and have other inputs to use in order to judge my character or values, in this context managed to hurt danah's feelings: the last thing I would have wanted to do.</p>

<p>What I crossed over into was that "unwelcome gaze" issue, not unlike in one of danah's earliest posts to misbehaving in which she wrote about being invited to a coed hot-tub party by a professional colleague and finding that uncomfortable as well.</blockquote><br />
In <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/05/publicly_processing_hurt.html">Apophenia "Publically Processing Hurt</a>, Dana responds:<blockquote>Don't get me wrong: i'm not screamingly upset. Frankly, i was far more nervous and concerned about posting the damn thing than going through the situation. But i wanted to lay out the experience, the emotions for others to read and understand. Not because i had worried myself sick or magnified the situation out of proportion. It was a situation, it would pass, but maybe some good would come out of posting it for others to see. It is the raw emotions, the logic in our heads that bring us to a situation. We rarely make this visible. For those who don't understand, the goal isn't to give you fodder to attack. Instead, try understanding what life from my perspective might look like. </p>

<p>And then the unexpected happened. Bless his heart, the owner of said comment made a public apology. He didn't need to own up to that statement, but he did. And he went on to offer his emotional reaction to my tinge of hurt. And he continued on to defend both me, my post and my sense of humor (ah, yes, public support is the quickest way to make me respect someone). So, i'm floored. And surprised. And terribly appreciative.</blockquote>I have some understanding of Christian -- I consider myself a conscious feminist, but sometimes our male world-view sets us up for a clash. I could easily see myself in his situation, realizing that there are so few women among my connections, trying to fix that, and then falling flat on my face.</p>

<p>I've run into this type of thing before at <a href="http://www.skotos.net/">Skotos</a> -- one of our games <a href="http://www.skotos.net/games/marrach/">Castle Marrach</a> is notable as a commercial game that has probably more women involved in it then men. This was a deliberate part of the game design, but when I talk about how and why we designed it that way it is easy for me to come across as sexist.</p>

<p>Also, the context is important. If this 'joke' had been spoken and in a semi-private medium where everyone knows and trusts each other, it would have come across very differently. Instead, it was sent to a circle of friends where everyone knew Christian, but not everyone knew each other. This is more proof that even 'friends of friends' can be a pretty distant connection. If the joke had been told at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">Live Journal</a>, which is also dominated by women (64%), it also would have come across differently.</p>

<p>I'm even uncomfortable writing this blog entry, because no matter what I do, there is no way I can precisely understand what it is like to be in Dana's place, or any women's place for that matter. All I can do is empathize with Dana discomfort and try to not make such mistakes myself.<br />

Also, how differently would it come across if women started a "cute geek guy" ratings discussion.  

Would guys just like it, or feel objectified also?

Personally, I wouldn't want to, I feel really uncomfortable with the Halley Suitt pro-flirtation model.

BODY:
<p>I have now had CEOs of three different social networks send me emails asking me to compare Orkut to their service. I've not had a chance to dig deeply into good answers for each specific one, but I did have some general advice that I wanted to offer given my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">recent experiences with Orkut.com</a>, and my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">evaluation</a> and <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/followup_to_eva.html">followup</a> on various social networking services in December.</p>

<h4>Privacy</h4>
First, be extremely careful about privacy issues. For some of you outside the US, you may not know about what has been going on in the area of identity theft, but it has become a significant problem. I am not a privacy fanatic, but I am concerned that social networking services encourage people to reveal too much information too broadly, and that this will be someday be taken advantage of by identity thieves. For instance, many services ask for birthday and reveal it to everyone. You can ask for the birthday, but don't display it -- give the person's age, or birth month, but don't give the full info. I personally am particularly wary of billing address, billing zip code, birthday, and potential common security questions like name of pet, mother's maiden name, etc. These are in addition to the obvious targets of identity theft like SSN, full name, and account numbers.

<p>Orkut's interface for selectively allowing some fields to be visible "only to myself", "to friends", or to "friends of friends" is nice, but I wish it was for all fields. I also think every field by default should be set to "only to myself". In fact, all security parameters should default to reveal the least information, and have the tightest limits -- allow the user to open selectively.</p>

<p>If you are going to support all different kinds of social networks (dating, friendships, activities, business) consider finding ways to make sure that those people who are not using the service for dating are not asked for that info, and don't see it for others who are dating. People who are only using it for dating shouldn't see business info. If someone is using a service for all types of relationships, allow people to selectively set what they reveal to each group, say two columns of "only to connections who are dating" or "only to business connections".</p>

<p>Never reveal someone's email address or other critical information without them knowing about it. In particular there are issues with emails sent among members. The only safe way is to do redirection through your site (although that will cost you bandwidth.) But if you can't do that, then just tell people "your email will be revealed if you do this" -- that is enough.</p>

<p>Work hard on your TOS and Privacy terms. Don't let your lawyers rule you here too much -- find some way to get your principles out there and still cover yourself against problems. Make all the personal information that people give you be their information -- they are only leasing it to you temporarily.</p>

<p>Make it easy for someone to quit the system. Maybe offer to them to export their information in case they want to rejoin later, and give them an opportunity to send a last message to any connections they may have. Be friendly at all times, and as the market shakes out they may come back.</p>

<h4>Connections & Invites</h4>
If possible, find some other way to call the connections between people "friends" -- maybe even use a unique trademarkable term. There is some power in the emotions behind the word friends that helps with the virus-like nature of social networking software, but I think in the long term it is a bad idea. LinkedIn and Spoke use the word connections which sounds too mechanical, but I think it is better then "friends".

<p>Don't encourage the "how many friends do my friends have" game. It sets up bad behaviors, and as you grow you don't want to have barriers of entry to new people who feel that they can't compete in that game. This means don't sort friends or groups etc. by the number of friends they have by default -- it can be an option, but just not be default.</p>

<p>Don't encourage people to by default upload their address book. Have that feature be off of some optional utility page. Have the default option for it to just scan for people that are already members of your system and to forget the rest -- that is effectively what I do with systems that ask for address book information, and they make it hard for me to do so. Don't store people's address information for them unless you can sync them with people's personal contact books -- save that for version 2.0, not 1.0 beta.</p>

<p>Don't focus on people contacting new people that are not already their connections. It is not the number of connections, but the quality. Instead, focus on helping people with their weak connections. It is 'reconnection' that is the most powerful feature of these social network services, not new connections. You can also help with "triage" -- how do I maximize the value of my existing weak connections with the least effort?</p>

<p>Allow people to opt-out with a custom message. What this means is that if someone sends an email to someone who has opted out, they will get something like. "Thanks for inviting me to Orkut -- I've decided for now not to join, but you can find me on Tribe." However, keep a list of people who have tried to connect to that opted-out user, and if that user does change their mind later, it will make it easier for them to have an initial list of friends that may already be on the service. Yes, I know that this risks sending people to other services, but there are so many now that you can get good buzz by doing the right thing, and recovering those people later when they have confidence in you.</p>

<p>You need to have better methods of handling invites from unknowns without saying no. For instance "I'm not sure I know you, have I forgotten?"</p>

<p>Related, don't fill out default text for invitations and other request forms -- force people to put something personal into the request, don't allow it to be blank. Never do what Orkut does and not give the opportunity to offer text when you invite someone who is already on the system.</p>

<p>Avoid anything beyond friends of friends as a primary part of your service. It bugs me that I see by default 3 degrees away in many services -- 2 degrees should be max by default, as that is the level that real referral can work. 3 degrees is too far for users to trust (though it can be optional for some purposes, or useful internally.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=6080f857- 4784-4679-8e41-c6881ed933ce">Friendship Circle</a> may also be a good idea, though perhaps how you classify people should be private. You may mark someone as being "family" "intimate" or "acquaintance" or "business", or whatever, however, no one else should see that; they should just see "connection" unless they have named you, and you in turn should not say that.</p>

<h4>Profiles</h4>
Find some better way then simple lists to do profiles. Someone's profile needs to express the richness of who they are -- it also needs to change and grow and flow over time, so make it easy for people to annotate and grow over time. Consider asking for only a few things at first, not make the process of filling out the profile feel daunting, then after each login prompt them to add one small thing that is useful based on how they used the service recently. For instance "You have joined the AnyoneButBush2004 group -- do you want to enter information to share with others about your political interests?".

<p>Right now lots of people are experimenting on their blog sidebars how best to profile themselves -- learn from them. Look at hundreds of examples, look for patterns beyond the obvious.</p>

<p>Allow people to have multiple affiliations, whether they be work or play. I'm a bad edge case personally, with too many hats to name, but almost everyone I know has at least two professional hats "Sysadmin by day, Writer by night", "Laywer on weekdays, Carpenter on weekends" , as well as several affiliation hats "Bay Area Costumer Guild president, member of League of Women Voters", etc.</p>

<p>Right now LinkedIn has the best looking professional profile, but it is still hard for some people to use. I like LinkedIn's use of multiple professional affiliations, however, I wish I could mark some as major or minor; for instance, there is a big difference between being an Advisor to MG Taylor and being CEO of Consensus. It also doesn't handle professional associations and lesser affiliations, much less non-professional affiliations and interests. Also, being able to arbitrarily order them would be nice, LinkedIn does it by date which can make for some confusing emphasis.</p>

<h4>Reputation & Endorsements</h4>
Be very careful of the design of rating systems and reputation systems. They are extremely difficult to design well, as they too often can be gamed, or fall into reciprocity such that they are meaningless. My personal advice is just don't do it at first -- save it for a 2.0 version of the product, not 1.0 beta. If you are going to do it now, really study it -- there is a lot of good academic research on issues of reputation. It can be hard to slog through but it is worth it. Offer a grant to Danah's school for them to do research for you on the topic.

<p>Endorsements are a best way of doing reputation for now. They is also is imperfect and vulnerable to reciprocity games, however, as least you can see if two people are playing that game just by looking at the endorser and endorsee. If you find too much reciprocity you can basically ignore both players.</p>

<p>Allow endorsements at a more granular level. For instance, if you are offering dating and professional information, segregate the endorsements. Even more ideally, do like LinkedIn and allow endorsements of relatively small things in a profile, for instance "I really enjoy Chris' blog" against the blog profile item, and "I like what Chris says about the environment" against my affiliation with a group. Consider allowing endorsements of groups: "Of the three groups here on Wiki, I find this one fits me the best".</p>

<p>If you can afford it, consider hiring a game designer from the online game industry who understands behavior incentives in online games. If you can't, study it. Part of the reason why EverQuest is the largest MMPORG is because it incentivizes certain kinds of social behaviors. In fact, it could be considered to be a type of social network service.</p>

<h4>Launch & Support</h4>
Be careful with your beta launch -- a culture for a community forms in the first few weeks, and our experience from online games is that the nature of this culture can make or break a project. Find ways to encourage the kinds of behaviors you want, and discourage those that you don't.

<p>Be very careful of labeling people who are gaming your product in ways you don't like. Being in Orkut's 'jail' is almost becoming a badge of honor. There is no reason why people who invite too many friends to join, submit too many posts to forums, or sends too many messages to friends of friends, should be put under the same label as those people who put child pornography up on your system and thus you've banned them. Instead, slow down the overly active people, just say in advance "If you invite this number of people, you may not invite more people for 24 hours, do you want to continue?", or "If you invite this person, you must wait an hour before inviting another.", etc. Also, if you do lock people out of a feature, don't lock them out of all features, just the one that they are over-using. If someone gets locked out of lots of features at the same time, then they should be looked at for possibly banning, but not if they are doing just one thing -- you want to encourage their enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Make sure you give feedback to anyone that tries to be helpful, for instance in reporting a bug. Ideally public reports should be encouraged public (as this encourages other people to be helpful) but even private reports should be encouraged, and as promptly as possible including "Thanks for taking time to write up this, we are logged this problem and hope to get to it as soon as we can given limited resources." Find other ways to give feedback, such as a weekly report, or a group developers blog.</p>

<p>Create multiple stages for your beta, for instance "profile features beta", "group features beta", "scaling beta", "load beta", etc. Tell people in your beta what you want to hear about and not hear at each stage. As each stage ends, find some way to publically thank those who made the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Set up a bug tracking system like TypePad has (like Bugzilla but hugely simpler to use). From help menu at the top you can click to post a new report, see all open reports, or see all closed reports. Every help page can have at the bottom to open a report on that topic. If anything goes wrong there (404, various system error messages, etc) you should give you an opportunity to open a report. </p>

<h4>Features</h4>
Figure out how to use RSS everywhere for input and output -- if Orkut or Tribe's group features supported RSS feeds, they could be very powerful competition to the hugely funded Friendster. Figure out how to use trackbacks with your system, and make them simpler for users. Make group bookmarks and other lists available as OPML. I'm not a huge fan of FOAF yet, but figure out how to use it anyhow (and maybe vCards) until something better comes along, if nothing else but allow someone to import it and export it.

<p>My personal take is that if you can combine a substantial number of these <br />
features, you could have a great product that gives the others a run for the <br />
money:<br />
<ul><li>Offering intentional groups (like Tribe and Orkut) is essential. It is Friendster's and LinkedIn's weakest link.</li><br />
<li>eVite/Meetup style invitations for both private functions (come to my birthday party), friend functions (anyone near 00301 want to have lunch Thursday?) and groups (Let's all meet for dinner next week to discuss this).</li><br />
<li>Ability to import via RSS the recent items from my blog to my profile page</li><br />
<li>Optional blogging-style home pages (FunChain & Live Journal) for those who don't already have blogs</li><br />
<li>Extended family support as an explicit type of group, grandmother, mother, child in college</a><br />
<li>Couples can be a form of a group also</li><br />
<li>Better ways to organize groups of groups</li><br />
<li>Better support for user-optional presence "There are members of this group who are reading it right now who have said that they are available online to members to this group, 3 via Skype, 12 via AIM"</li><br />
<li><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=94333937-ecd8-4d08-994d-7f4c96c523dd">Permachat</a> at a group level is an interesting idea. I hate that I can't see chat text before the point I logged in</li><br />
<li>Lots of group management support, for instance:<br />
<ul><li>ability to have multiple admins (eGroups, Live Journal)</li><br />
<li>Group moderation (Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Advogato, etc.)</li><br />
<li>Optional group shared links (eGroups)</li><br />
<li>Optional group shared calendar (eGroups)</li><br />
<li>Polling inside groups (no one that I know of)</li><br />
<li>Invitation or approval of entry by different methods, such as by vote, by 1 reference from existing member, etc. (none that I know of)</li><br />
<li>Ability to merge groups (none that I know of) </li></ul></li><li>Wiki-style areas available for groups (no one that I know of)</li><br />
<li>Combine all the above with good innovative RSS and optionally Atom (FunChain, SocialText)</li><br />
<li>Supports the various blog submission APIs for blogs, wiki, and groups (none that I know of)<br />
<li>Do a great job for those who don't use RSS and those APIs to use email instead, including email submission (you can mail pages to a SocialText wiki)</li><br />
<li>Ability to be federated, i.e. I could still use my existing blog (you just mirror it), RSS aggregation, my FOAF file could be synced, you sync with my addressbook at Yahoo, etc.</li><br />
</ul></p>

<h4>Business Models</h4>
Business models for social networking services is going to be one of the biggest issues. Even those social networking sites with lots of money behind them are going to have difficulty because there are so many.

<p>The paid subscriber model is probably dead until some of the VC funded startups go out of business. Advertising can be a good model, but be careful not to make it obtrusive -- remember, Google has made good money with very simple ads.</p>

<p>If you don't have VC funding, find ways to co-opt partners -- build from the beginning support for Google AdSense and Adwords, Amazon APIs, etc. If you are small, consider federating with another company. Figure out what you can do to differentiate yourself from both your competitors and partners.</p>

<p>Don't be evil.</p>

<h4>Me</h4>
I am interested in getting more professionally involved with social software. I think we are still in Apple II days of social software -- we see the promise of things to come, but we are still typing in ALL CAPS. Given the overfunding in this field, my own ability to start a company as an <a href="http://www.alacrityventures.com">angel investor</a> is insufficient, so I'm looking to partner with others. I've been involved with online communities, groupware, collaboration, and security for over 20 years. If you are interested in an executive in this area, see my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=62844">profile on LinkedIn</a>.

Some notes:

a) On privacy -- the list of people who tried to reach you is two-edged,
you may want to point that out, because it gathers my list of friends,
and somebody else might come and get it, but it is pretty useful.

b) All these ideas and many others are good, and I have my own lists
of useful features,  but there's some huge feature creep and it will
be tough for the people doing this software to cherry pick.

c) I have notes in the orkut forum (I presume you posted this there)
about dealing with people you don't remember.  It doesn't work to force
me to send them a note saying "where do I know you from?" because if
you forgot them it's still embarassing.   You need to establish a principle
in advance that people doing an invite include where they know you from.

Unless they are intimate friends.

d) On dating/non-dating, I agree that we don't want to see that our
business associate is in an open marriage.  However I am not sure the
moded UI (you are either in biz mode or dating mode) will fly.  I had
big plans for such modes, on backburner for now.

A better idea would be to only show you dating info on people who are
potential dates.   Ie. if you are an M seeking F, you only see dating
info of F seeking Ms.  People want the serendipity of knowing, "Oh, that
women I met at the conference is single and looking?"

Best of all it doesn't require new UI.

The other big thing with Orkut is going to be the FoF spam.  The mail
volume must be limited some way.  We've got many thousands of FoF it
seems.

Good advice overall.  You might want to take a fast look at how phpbb does polls (re your "polling inside groups" note).  It's integrated into the comment posting interface so you can very quickly turn any entry into a poll, with a few simple options.

I'd also be interested in seeing your comments on pay vs. free membership options.

What do you think about the political applications of friendster-like sites?  Think how it helps solve the problems associated with the ghetto email petitions of the past, and how it could create a non-intrusive, viral fundraising medium.  Do you agree with me?

Given the multiple kinds of ways that people want to use social software (e.g., business networking, dating, politics), will there be specific sites for each kind of activity or will there be some sharing model?

Anyway, we're thinking about leveraging this trend and it would be helpful to get your thoughts as we consider build vs. partnering, etc.

FriendBlend is another new social networking site you might want to take a look at - it combines match-making with blogs, moblogs, online photo sharing and a lot of the group features such as polling and quizes that you mention. Great post!

is virtually unknown in the US but becoming very popular in Spain and Latin America, and they're becoming a trend-setter, integrating email groups (a la YahooGroup but perhaps even more customizable), social networking tools and online auctions. A weird combination that however it seems to be working ok so far.

Thanks for posting this your section about privacy is very useful. There are some issues regarding privacy and social networking sites that have not been addressed properly and may cause the downfall of social networking sites such as stalkers and identity fraudsters.

BODY:
<p>I've not just been spending time looking at social networking services, I've also been digging deeper into wiki. I've still got more to go, but some of these will be of interest to you if you are considering implementing a wiki for your community, or if you are a wiki developer.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zwiki.org">Zwiki</a> is based on Zope, and thus has a very interesting feature set. One of the more popular features is the topic mappings that it creates. When combined with the CMS features of Plone, it becomes even more interesting -- one of the best Zwiki/Plone communities to look at as an example is <a href="http://doc.hydrogenaudio.org/wikis/hydrogenaudio/FrontPage">Hurricane Audio</a>. Unfortunately Zwiki only works on the Zope web platform, which is not as popular as Apache.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flexwiki.com">FlexWiki</a> is a very innovative wiki that is being developed by some Microsoft engineers and is ASP.NET based for Windows. I in particular like the <a href="http://flexwiki.com/default.aspx/FlexWiki.ExamplePropertyPage">property page features</a> which are an elegant way to handle meta-data, and also how it handles diffs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.projectforum.com">ProjectForum</a> and <a href="http://www.courseforum.com">courseforum</a> are both fairly simple but elegant commercially supported wiki. Of particular note is that both are very easy to install, even on a Windows 2000 system or Macintosh, as well as on Linux. I was able to get a test ProjectForum up on my Windows PC in about 5 minutes, including downloading. It also has some nice &quot;skins&quot; available. I also like how private areas are created for each -- this is the basic difference between the two products, and a rare wiki feature.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/">WikidPad</a> is interesting because it is not a public service, but a shareware single-user &quot;notepad&quot; for Windows that supports wiki-style TextFormattingRules and WikiWords. If you have been using wiki a lot like I have, sometimes you catch yourself using wiki-style text everywhere, and I guess this product is for people who do that like me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.socialtext.com">SocialText</a> is another commercially supported wiki, but is sold as a service not a product. They are very carefully added features while keeping things elegant and simple for less sophisticated business customers. They also host a number of public wikis, so if you want to see the current feature set see <a href="http://http://www.socialtext.net/rss-winterfest">RSS-Winterfest</a> which also shows off their newest RSS support.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seedwiki.com">SeedWiki</a> is another wiki service rather then product (sometimes called a WikiFarm), and is interesting because it doesn't use Wiki style TextFormattingRules -- instead, it has several WYSIWYG editors that allow you to directly edit the underlying HTML. This gives a huge amount of flexibility for some of the communities that use it, such as <a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=WikiFish&amp;wikiid=1231">WikiFish</a>.</p>

<p>I also have heard good things about PHPWiki and MoinMoin, but I haven't had a chance to dig into those very much yet.</p>

<p>I personally have been using <a href="http://www.twiki.org">TWiki</a> for 4+ years at several of my businesses. Its strength is that it is oriented toward allowing private groups who can manage their own access privileges. It also has one of the most active 'plugins' developer areas with lots of ways to modify your TWiki to do different things (one of the plugins I'm investigating now is <a href="//http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/EvEm&gt;EvEm&lt;/a&gt;). My only complaints are that TWiki is rather hard to install, and that the default skin isn't very elegant (I recommend the &lt;a href=">GnuSkin</a>, but read the docs very carefully as you have to chmod a module if you install it.)</p>

<p>Although it uses a fairly primitive wiki, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballWiki">Meatball Wiki</a> site for people very interested in wikis. It is a meta-wiki discussion community. It has some great pages on the life-cycle of wikis, on various design patterns and features of wikis, and of various other consequences of the medium. If you look at <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?back=CategoryWikiEngine">CategoryWikiEngine</a> it has one of the more complete lists of Wiki engines out there.</p>

<p>I will be reporting more on various wikis and wiki technology that I discover in the upcoming weeks.</p>

Yes, I do know about those features, but I hadn't intended for this post to be an exhaustive review, just a paragraph in or so for each. The fact that you have lots of features is why I referred people to the public rss-winterfest site.

I am thinking about doing some more detailed reviews soon, though, and SocialText is near the top of the list.

Flexwiki doesn't even work with my Mozilla browser.

I'd also recommend MediaWiki (used for all the Wikipedia sites), SnipSnap (java based wiki+blog), and Tiki.

The importance of wiki is that WikiIsDocumentBased.
 ( <a href="http://communitywiki.org/WikiIsDocumentBased">http://communitywiki.org/WikiIsDocumentBased</a> )

IM, IRC, e-mail, all that stuff is message based. This is the first document based medium.

Documents are big heavy things that float around for long periods of time. Messages are flitty things that are useful for a very short period of time. Documents are good for stabilizing massive teachings that don't change often. Messages are good for coordinations and handling new things quickly.

We need both. Wiki is essential.

BODY:
<p>Another Orkut user and I have confirmed a privacy hole in Orkut whenever you send a message to someone via Orkut.</p>

<p>For instance, whenever I send a message to anyone in the system that is forwarded by email, in the message headers it will read:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
From: "Christopher Allen" &lt;member@orkut.com&gt;
Reply-To: "Christopher Allen" &lt;christophera@alacritymanagement.com>;</pre></blockquote>

<p>When someone reads the message in their email software, the "From:" line will be my name but the fake email of &lt;member@orkut.com&gt; -- however, when you reply to it, it will use my real email address. This appears to happen whether or not I have my privacy settings to reveal my email address. For instance, I can set it so that no one (not friends, not friends of friends, only myself) can see my email address, but the address will still be revealed when I send an email</p>

<p>I had reported what I thought was a security flaw when you emailed to "friends of friends" a couple of days ago, but I was mistaken, as I reported in my blog <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">Insecurity at Orkut</a>.  However, as I didn't want risk "crying wolf" this time, so my friend and I triple checked this and have confirmed this privacy flaw.</p>

<p><s>They only way that I know of to avoid this is in your prefences to set that all of your messages should be sent to you via the web, not email.</s> [Updated: I was wrong, there is no way currently to avoid this other then not using an email address you care about.]</p>

<p>There are some that will say that this is a feature, i.e. when using email "what good is communicating with someone if there is no chance of a response" -- my answer to this is that an expectation has been set that email addresses can remain private, and if this is to be a feature, then users should be warned before sending an email "Your email address user@domain will be revealed when you send this." More ideally, like other social networking services, the "Reply-to:" should be to a special email address at Orkut that will do the lookup and forward appropriately.</p>

<p>One of the essential problems that Orkut needs to fix very soon is how to report problems like these, and if you are trying to help how to know that these problems exist. I want my criticism to be constructive, but it is very hard when you have no idea what is the best way to offer feedback. I've had many people reply to me in my blog and via email that they feel the same way.</p>

<p>For instance, right now there are 6 Orkut groups about Orkut:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=617">What Should Orkut Do?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=2026">Flaws in Orkut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=3982">Orkut</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=1289">Orkut Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=781">Orkut: Tips, Feedback, ?'s</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=4556">Orkut Members</a></li></ul>

<p>Which groups should I post this problem to? Which will will be read by the Orkut staff?</p>

<p>As I've said in another of my blog postings <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/followup_on_ork.html">Followup on Orkut</a>: <blockquote>Part of the problem is that even though Orkut is in beta, there is no organized feedback system. For instance they could offer a forum read by the developers, or even better a bug/issues tracking system like TypePad has, or Bugzilla.</p>

<p>In addition, feedback is a two-way street -- they could do a lot by offering a developers daily blog, or some type of regular announcement of what feature they wanted beta testers to test that day, or even acknowledgement "we already know that is an issue". Also, they need to show respect for good feedback publicly, as that will encourage more good feedback.</p>

<p>None of this is happening at this time, which means that people get frustrated, which also makes it easy rumors and conspiracy to spread. I want to be a constructive critic, but Orkut makes it hard for me to be so.</blockquote></p>

<p>For now, I recommend that these type of bug reports go into <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Community.aspx?cmm=6048">Orkut Beta</a></li>. Why not in "Flaws in Orkut" or in one of the other groups? Because I feel that focusing on 'Flaws' is too strongly negative, and none of the others quite fit. I've been a software developer -- everything is a compromise and good design is hard. By staying on the topics of current features, feature requests, bugs, suggestions, and by encouraging constructive critism and a balance of both positive and negative feedback, this group will be the best community for us to help Orkut until they offer us better alternatives.<br />

In the above I said "They only way that I know of to avoid this is in your prefences to set that all of your messages should be sent to you via the web, not email."

However, this is incorrect, it will still send your email address in the 
"Reply-To:"

At this time there is no way I know of to avoid this flaw if you are concerned about your email address other then changing it to a temporary one.

That's a pretty big "bug" (or unpublished feature) indeed (!)

For example, personally I try to keep my work email address off the net as much as possible, and have set pretty strict privacy settings on orkut, assuming they'd keep it private...

Coincidentally (!!??) the amount of spam I'm receiving at my work email address has gone up vastly since joining Orkut... A very odd coincidence...

I discovered why I got 'jailed' for a third time today. Two of us appear to have been jailed because of a bug when posting to groups. What happens is that if you write a long post, rather then the system tell you something is wrong, your posting form will just be refreshed. This will prompt you to submit a few more times, unsuccessfully. Then you realize it must be because your post is too long, so you'll remove text a few times, and submit. At some point in this process, typically before you successfully trim it down enough to successfully post, you will discover you are in Orkut jail.

Of course, that makes us long-winded bloggers particularly vulnerable ;-)

BODY:
<p>I've read of emails, Orkut messages, and blog postings since my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/insecurity_at_o.html">post yesterday</a>, so I thought I would share some with you.</p>

<p>There have been a number of good posts, as well as user comments at Danah Boyd's blog <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">Apophenia</a>.</p>

<p>Danah Boyd writes <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/01/correcting_marc_canters_perception_of_my_views.html#004011">Correcting Marc Canter's Perception of My Views</a><br />
<blockquote>Marc - i don't believe that users should take these relationships more seriously; i believe that YOU should. Users will do whatever they damn well please, and i think that we should learn from them. But out of respect to the creators of these systems, many of whom are our friends, i truly believe that we should respect their goals and not engage in behavior that disrespects their intentions. Furthermore, i believe that we should never be the exceptions on any given service, the ones who push the boundaries. We are not average users. We should sit back and watch what average users do, not try to top them. By engaging in disrespectful behavior, we make it much harder for our friends and colleagues to execute their business plans as they're busy policing us.</blockquote>When I first read this, I thought of something else. When I saw Danah's "YOU", I was thinking of myself and Marc Canter as developers. I'm not currently involved in developing Social Software, but I come from the developer mind set. "WE" developers "should take these relationships more seriously". That means that although our users will game, will play, and stretch the system, we should design it as seriously as possible those who are serious, concerned, and value their relationships.  "Calling someone a friend" <b>should</b> mean something -- something important.</p>

<p>Danah Boyd asks in <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/31/banned_from_orkut.html">Banned from Orkut</a> <br />
<blockquote>I keep hearing about folks who have been kicked off or "jailed" from Orkut. I'd love to hear more about this. Who all is getting banned? Why? Are you given explanations? What happens when you try to fight?</blockquote></p>

<p>I offered in the <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/31/banned_from_orkut.html#comments">comments there</a> some of my observations on being "jailed" now there twice.</p>

<p>Danah asks <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/what_is_beta_in_the_context_of_social_software.html">What is Beta in the context of Social Software?</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What does the term 'beta' mean in social software? It's become an ongoing joke since Friendster is *still* in beta.<br />
...<br />
I find it quite disconcerting that people want to label their distributions "beta" for over a year because it hasn't been perfected, because new versions are coming out. This, to me, seems like an abuse of the term beta. New versions always come out. Is beta simply an excuse?<br />
...<br />
I am really uncomfortable with public distributions of software being labeled as beta (or alpha), particularly when the population joining it is not aware of it being truly an alpha/beta.</blockquote>I think this is important -- just saying something is 'beta' is too easy. We've have learned this in the online game industry -- how beta is managed sets the culture of your community very early on, and has a huge effect on "buzz". <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com">Dark Ages of Camelot</a> Game Designer Dave Rickey wrote an excellent column on this at Skotos last month <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/engines13.phtml">Plan Your Fight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The problems arise because of the differing agendas of the parties involved in bringing the games to and through the beta process, and their differing expectations of what they are supposed to accomplish. The fact is, our traditional Alpha/Beta division does not serve the needs of these games well. Well before the full featureset is in place, the complexity surpasses the point where internal QA processes are adequate to cope. You simply can't even make a serious attempt at full-regression organized QA; the manpower requirements are far too high.<br />
...<br />
Beyond that, there are the marketing implications. Ideally, Beta isn't about marketing, it's about making the games work. In the real world, only a fool ignores the impact of "beta buzz". Beta testers telling their friends "You've got to try this game" is the most powerful marketing force in the industry. A few thousand evangelists working their personal social networks is better than millions of dollars of paid advertising. By the same token, beta testers saying "don't bother, it sucks" can kill a game, no matter how much money is spent on marketing.</blockquote>He further recommends that beta be actually broken into more categories <b>Development Beta</b>, <b>Playtesting Beta</b>, <b>Scaling Beta</b>, and <b>Load Beta</b>. Part of the problem with Orkut is that they are lost in Scaling and Load Beta, when they need more Development and Playtesting Beta.</p>

<p>Another interesting blog entry found from in a comment at Danah's site, written by Jeremy Zawodny: <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001504.html">Why Google needs Orkut</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What surprises me is that nobody has looked at it the other way around: What problems might Orkut solve that Google would otherwise find significantly more challenging?<br />
...<br />
Suddenly they're able to set a *.google.com cookie that contains a bit of identifying data (such as your Orkut id) and that would greatly enhance their ability to mine useful and profitable data from the combination of your profile and daily searches.</p>

<p>Of course, we know that the "big three" already do this sort of thing to some degree or another. But Google's lack of intimate knowledge of their users is surely holding them back from doing some of the things they'd love to do. Many folks think it's just a matter of time before they try to get "real" users signed up.</blockquote></p>

<p>I personally don't think Google is institutionally really that aware of Orkut. If anything, the negativity that the beta has raised may actually be causing this skunkworks group some headaches, given that Google is trying to go public. But yes, in the long term if Orkut is successful and absorbed into Google, this information will be used this way.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/02/01/correcting_marc_canters_perception_of_my_views.html#comments">comment to Danah's blog</a>, <a href="http://www.bladam.com/">Adam Lasnik</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>I have agreed with the majority of your complaints about orkut, danah, and indeed, have found myself also disappointed in what I feel is the lost opportunity (so far) for what Orkut (the guy) and Google (the company) could have set up from the get go. They have the means, the finances, and so on to have set up a truly sophisticated and thoughtful social network. I still optimistically think that orkut.com will amount to something impressive (useful and/or just damn fun) someday, though I wish the structure had been more sophisticated from the beginning.</p>

<p>With that said, I do have to agree with what I read from someone else recently (apologies -- the specific source is escaping me!) about how perhaps the ambiguity and unsophisticated structure of orkut.com is intentional... letting members shape things as they go along, almost as folks might build a sim-city from the ground up.</p>

<p>Perhaps. And perhaps not. I don't know.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'll continue to use orkut.com until it's either no longer fun and useful for me, or I feel it has no hopes of BECOMING fun and useful. At that time (and probably before), I'll be airing my concerns privately to the orkut.com team and publicly on my blog... but I'll maintain my respect for Orkut, orkut.com, Google, and the service terms to which I agreed to when I signed up.</p>

<p>I wish others would do the same.</blockquote>Adam further points to his blog entry <a href="http://www.bladam.com/archives/0401302002.htm">Don't like it? Go home and don't come back</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>But on the whole, I think folks who are unhappy with orkut (or any other privately-owned-and-run service) have exactly two choices:
<li>stick with the service, but publicly or privately express concerns</a>
<li>quit the service (and, yep, still publicly or privately express concerns if they wish)</a></blockquote>

<p>In general I agree with Adam, if you are unhappy quit.</p>

<p>However, his first choice was "publicly or privately express concerns". I've been chastised for expressing publicly concerns about Orkut. For instance I was sent this message from someone by the Orkut message system:<br />
<blockquote>You are a bit annoying, and you seem to go about making things a better in the same way a child goes about crying to his mom because he didn't get his 4th lemon pop in a row.</blockquote>Other then my first mistaken email about a possible "friends of friends" email security issue, I feel that my comments have been constructive. Yet obviously I've hit some nerves (probably a good thing for Orkut that people are feeling that passionate to be defensive about it).</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that even though Orkut is in beta, there is no organized feedback system. For instance they could offer a forum read by the developers, or even better a bug/issues tracking system like TypePad has, or Bugzilla.</p>

<p>In addition, feedback is a two-way street -- they could do a lot by offering a developers daily blog, or some type of regular announcement of what feature they wanted beta testers to test that day, or even acknowledgement "we already know that is an issue". Also, they need to show respect for good feedback publicly, as that will encourage more good feedback.</p>

<p>None of this is happening at this time, which means that people get frustrated, which also makes it easy rumors and conspiracy to spread. I want to be a constructive critic, but Orkut makes it hard for me to be so.</p>

<p>I've also received some interesting comments via email or Orkut messages.</p>

<p>This one about my concern about emails revealed when you send to "friends of friends":<br />
<blockquote>When you give your trust to anyone, they can choose to abuse it, just like in real life. For example, I don't know how delighted Megan is that you chose to compose your glorious-whistle-blowing-yeah-look-at-me-I-pretended-I-was-friends-with-these-people-but-I am-not-and-I-am-so-r337-in-exposing-a-"security hole"-in-this-site message, but, as always, these actions can be remedied. For example, she can choose to remove you from her friends list, just like in real life "friends" who abuse someone's trust are not their friends anymore. This way you also very efficiently negatively advertise yourself to all of her friends so that they now know to stay away from you.</blockquote></p>

<p>I wonder if this type of behavior will happen? So far on any of these social networking services I've never seen a message "you have been removed from X's friend list". It is possible that I have been removed by someone, but so far I have not been told. And will someone look at someone friends list and say "ah, he is no longer on there, so I will remove him". Right now, I doubt it.</p>

<p>One of my favorite messages sent to me on Orkut:<br />
<blockquote>I don't like that it's not easy to opt out. I've already had to delete a flame from my "scrapbook" and I could see how this could turn ugly quickly. Without an opt-out I don't see how I have any way of getting out of there quickly if there's a problem. Maybe what they need is a way for me to put myself in jail for a period of time.</blockquote></p>

Orkut is plural of rather sensitive word in finnish language (sexual climax). Just to mention.

Well,from my first impressions of orkut,what i gather is that,u have to be careful in who u select as friends(incase of a stranger sending u a friend request).As for getting familiar with a person that can always be done by sending a few messages through the scrap book(before u accept the frind invite).Other very useful feature of the scrapbook is that it almost serves the purpose of an instant messenger(conversations being publicly viewable though),with the community feature you can make friends with like minded people by joiing communities.Havent gone through all the features yet,but if you dont go too much into the nitty gritties then it is all in all quite a decent product.And of course with a popular name like google backing it,this can only improve (google wont shelve it as it just has become way too popular in the beta stage itself)

BODY:
<p>Like many others, I've been paying attention to <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a> in the last couple of weeks. I've answered more requests to be &quot;friends&quot; on Orkut then I have of any of the other half-dozen Social Networking Services I've tried, and I've looking at other people's friends to see if I know anyone. I've yet to ask someone to join Orkut that wasn't already a member, and I've been careful to not have anyone as a &quot;friend&quot; that I didn't know reasonably well and I thought knew me. Currently I have 68 Orkut &quot;friends&quot;, many more then I have on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn</a>, which I've been using for several months and have 50 &quot;connections&quot;.</p>

<p>In addition to this activity on Orkut, I've been reading a lot of blogs about other people's experiences on Orkut. In particular, I've found Danah Boyd's blog <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/">Apophenia</a> a great source for thought on social networking services, so I've got it near the top of my RSS aggregator. I'd just read her rant <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html">venting my contempt for Orkut</a> when I saw a follow up post <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.html">orkut pissyness round 2</a> where I read:</p><blockquote><p>Wanna see a big phat privacy hole on Orkut? Go to messages. Click compose. Click &quot;friends and friends of friends.&quot; Click next. Copy &amp; paste all of your friends and their friends' email addresses.</p></blockquote><p>I tested this out, and discovered she was correct, when I clicked &quot;friends of friends&quot; I got a long web page of names and email address. So I sent to this list I'd generated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A serious security hole? Yep.

</p>

<p>I just was shown 1137 friend and friends of friends email address, including your email address. As reported by Zephoria:</p>

<p>http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.htm</p></blockquote><p>I got a lot of replies back like &quot;What did you expect?&quot; and &quot;That is why I don't use my main email for Orkut&quot;.

</p>

<p>I also got a reply from Orkut Buyukkokten via email:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>Could you please send an email to your friends and friends of friends to tell them that there is no security hole?

</p>

<p>We worked very hard to ensure that the privacy of our members is not compromised in any way. I don't want our members to get the wrong impression.</p>

<p>I would greatly appreaciate it if you could pass the following message to you friends (:</p>

<p>You'll only see the e-mail addresses of people who chose to share them with you: if you mark your email address as not to be shared with friends and friends of friends, they won't be able to get your address this way. If you look at the list of people it's addressed to, you'll see that some are listed without addresses (unless you've got very permissive friends).</p></blockquote>

<p>Somewhat abashed, I checked, and since the last time I'd sent an email, the interface changed. I discovered that only 356 of 1137 of my friends of friends were actually allowing their email to be shown, and the rest now showed a &quot;lock&quot; icon next to their name. Of course, the first 100 or so on that list coincidentally allowed their emails to be shown, so I had assumed incorrectly that all had.</p>

<p>So I sent Orkut's reply out to my &quot;friends of friends&quot; and added links to my blog and this comment:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>I'm still quite uncomfortable with privacy issues of Orkut.com at this time. I've had to reveal more information then I'm comfortable, and the software is too lax in letting me see other people's info, for instance &quot;relationship status&quot; when I've marked myself as not interested in that. Maybe Orkut is just trying to be too much.</p></blockquote><p>I sent an email back to Orkut saying that I'd sent this email, then continued to get a lot of replies to my original email, and I discovered that I was now in Orkut &quot;jail&quot;. This meant that I could not send messages, could not add friends or groups, etc. No reason was given for why I was in jail. The only reason why I'd seen <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/2004/01/29.html#a2216">other people in jail</a> was because they had added too many friends too fast. I had only 50+ friends at the time, so I knew that wasn't the reason. I could only assume the worse.

</p>

<p>I'm out of Orkut &quot;jail&quot; this morning, but I still don't have any explanation of why. I continued to get replies both in support of my concerns:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>I tend to agree with you. I've learned more information than I expected about people. Also it's been a little odd to see people I know professionally on orkut, since I first conceptualized it as a social-friends service. (Then again, I've found professors on Friendster, which is much more explicitly social, so perhaps I'd better just accept that these people have lives.)

</p>

<p>At the same time, I think that Orkut's attempt to be all things to all people has helped it take off. I feel easier asking professional contacts to join orkut than I would for Friendster. It seems like less of a big deal to add someone to your orkut list rather than on another more focused service, as there is a level of plausible deniability as to intention. </p></blockquote><p>As well as comments like:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't want to be too harsh, but if perhaps you, and Danah, and Cory don't want to play then really no one is forcing you to play. But whining about things that you don't like is just, well, unseemly.</p></blockquote><p>I took a break to think on why I responded so negatively when Orkut has the appearance of doing something wrong (first, the 'security hole' that was a feature, and secondly the 'jail'). Then it came to me:

</p>

<p><strong><em>I'm insecure about orkut.</em></strong></p>

<p>Some of the definitions of 'insecure' are <em>not firm or firmly fixed; likely to fail or give way; lacking self-confidence or assurance; not safe from attack; lacking in security or safety; not financially safe or secure;</em>. The one that fits me the best is &quot;lacking self-confidence or assurance&quot;. Why do I feel this way about Orkut?</p>

<p>I guess my insecurity started out at the very beginning. As it is in beta, you can't join Orkut, you have to be invited. This made the place seem 'exclusive' and thus possibly safer. Yet right off it asks you some fairly personal questions: What is your relationship style? What is your sexual orientation? Who are you living with? What are your politics?</p>

<p>Later I find out by looking at other people's information that this is all completely public. It isn't limited to just friends, or friends of friends, but instead is prominent. In fact, other then your name and how many &quot;friends&quot; you have, your relationship style is the most prominent thing listed. Do I really want to know that my business acquaintance that I see only at technical conferences 2 or 3 times a year is in an open marriage? Or divorced? Or gay?</p>

<p>I live in the Bay Area and I've seen it all, and consider myself open and try to be consciously non-prejudiced. That's not to say that I'm comfortable when I'm hit on by another man, but for that matter, I'm not that comfortable when I'm hit on by a woman. The point is that I don't think about someone's sexual and personal choices when I interact with them. I don't care if you are gay, into S&amp;M, or any other radical lifestyle. I don't care if your straight, chaste, and christian. What I do care about is your relationship to me -- if you feel that it is important to your identity to let me know, well that is between us. But I'm not going to pry. I once had a male employee in my office that wore a dress to work -- I still don't know if he is gay or not. It didn't matter to me and he didn't tell me -- what mattered was that he was good employee.</p>

<p>This started my 'insecurity' about Orkut. Later I read that you couldn't delete your pictures or profiles. This worried me. Then I read that the system was down because of a XML hack.</p>

<p>When Orkut came back after the hack, a new feature was added, fans and ratings. This made me yet even more uncomfortable. Did I really want to have to not say I was a fan of someone that said they were a fan of me? Wasn't endorsing someone a far better signifier of fan? What does Trustworthy mean? Cool? I refused to enter anything for Sexy. I worried if someone could see my ratings, or reverse socially engineer it, or hack it.</p>

<p>Thus these insecurities of mine led me to think the worst and to post too quickly about the &quot;Friends of Friends Security Hole&quot; and still feel uncomfortable about why I was put in &quot;jail&quot;.</p>

<p>So far I've had no abuses of me by Orkut -- I've had only two people ask me to be friends that I don't know, and so far I've not been told that someone is my fan whom I'm not willing to honestly say that I'm a fan back. I've even found some old friends that I'd lost track of, which is exactly why I still &quot;play&quot; and not leave Orkut. I do believe that there may be something useful in these social network services.</p>

<p>Yet I feel that my old blog entry <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">Evaluating Social Network Services</a> that concluded with my take on <strong>The Perfect Social Network Service</strong> is still quite on track:<br />
</p><blockquote><p>My ideal service would have the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affiliations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryze, but less clunky.</p></blockquote>

<p>I'd add to that list that I'd like to have more control over my information, in particular, relationship information. That I'd like to see more &quot;progressive disclosure&quot; where there was more granularity of what was revealed at public, friends of friends, friends, fans, fans who I've endorsed, etc. Finally, I'd really not like to see things that are not applicable to me, such as relationship information of other people when I'm not looking for relationships, or professional information of others if I'm only using Orkut for dating.</p>

<p>[Update: another Orkut user and I found a different privacy hole when sending emails -- see <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/02/confirmed_email.html">Confirmed Email Privacy Hole at Orkut</a>.]</p>

The only reason why I'd seen other people in jail was because they had added too many friends too fast.

There is no basis in this assumption other than, maybe, a little hubris. The constant repetition of this unfounded claim speaks volumes about the research and professionalism of those perpetuating it. Marc, at least, had a question mark after that sentence. 

Fact is, some people have been "jail"-ed for violating the Orkut TOS, namely the posting of images of children or nude photography. One person I know of has been suspended for posting copyrighted images. Now, one may think that the limitations are overly stupid and should be changed, but as it stands a look at Marc's profile shows, that he has been most likely suspended for the images of his children. I think is is safer to assume, he has been "jailed" for violating the TOS, than for having too many "friends".

Hmm, nothing in the message said anything about TOS. In fact, I later received an email from Orkut saying "Your account was blocked by the system automatically. The block is temporary. Your account should be fine now. I apologize for the inconvenience."

I still don't know why I was in "jail" last night, and in fact, now I'm in "jail" again late today, so I can only assume that it is because I sent another email to "friends of friends" as that is the only common event between last night and today.

If they use the "jail" for TOS as well as for slowing down people like Marc and I, then I think that is a big mistake to use the same name for both purposes.

What is your proof for the "slowing down" of Marc?
His assertions aside, Marc is by far not the most prolific linker, and has not been adding friends as fast as some others, who are neither in Jail nor suspended. Other, much less prolific linkers, have been suspended, all of which share the fact that their actions (the posting of children pics) violated an admittedly stupid TOS provision. At this point, it's Marc's assumption ("they don't like me, because I link a lot of people") against a trend in suspensions that is closely related to what images have been posted.

I too am concerned about a lot of things regarding Orkut, and working on a post of my own about it. But, just to contribute to this, I've sent two messages to friends of friends and haven't been in Jail or anything yet.

There's quite a bit of granularity already, since launch, which you continue to ignore. Every one of your hypothetically incomfortable tidbits of information are filterable by social distance, that is, yourself, friends, friends of friends, everyone. And I can only expect that you will be able to filter by karma/fan, since that would be one of the only primary benefits to the end user of the karma system. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "XML hole". Perhaps you meant XSS? To my knowledge, the precise reasoning for Orkut's shutdown has not been revealed, but judging by what I've noticed has changed, it seems like they took it down to remove the ability of users to broadcast messages to the everyone on the site. The reply-to-all button is gone, and you can no longer send a message to a saved search.

I can think of more applicable (and offensive) words for the orkut-bashing chicken-littles than "unseemly".

I don't like that it's not easy to opt out. I've already had to delete a flame from my "scrapbook" and I could see how this could turn ugly quickly. Without an opt-out I don't see how I have any way of getting out of there quickly if there's a problem. Maybe what they need is a way for me to put myself in jail for a period of time.

I've joined a few social networks, revealing things about myself that I don't mind if everyone reads.  Things I don't want 'everyone' to know, I don't add to these networks.  

I also choose my communities/tribes/groups knowing everyone will be able to see my interests, and have avoided joining some I considered interesting but don't want linked to my profile.

I use disposable email addresses for social groups; when weaknesses are found, I'm not disturbed by it.  I think others might be though, because they might reveal more about themselves that what I did.  I've changed my settings to not expose my address to everyone (I think, there's a lot of places to check).

I think it's good that weaknesses are exposed, even publicly.  Not picking on any particular network, but if a person found a weakness in it, and reported it to them, there's a chance it would be missed/overlooked/ignored.  

Perhaps there are some that would take a reported weakness about their network very seriously, probably not as many though.

So by making the weaknesses public, I think it puts a fire under the developers to patch the hole.  Would Orkut's hole have been patched as quickly as it was if the persons that found the hole had reported it to them instead of publicly?  Maybe, maybe not.

If a network does take immediate measures to patch holes as soon as they're reported, I'd think it would be nice to give them advance notification before going public with the breach.  But I'm pessimistic about this, and think it probably takes threat of bad publicity to get some networks to patch.

Keep up the good works; your blog is very interesting, and I've subbed your RSS in my Bloglines.

I also felt insecure about Orkut, I went to jail maybe because of too many friends in short time (281), but I did not receive any explanation, do not know when the jail will be open and do not know why and when it could be closed again.

Regarding your perfect vision of a social networking service:  I guess one could say there maybe other features that someone else might like and visa versa.  So, maybe the perfect service would allow you to pick and choose from a menu of features and services.

I realize this is kind of late to respond... But Every bit of information other than your name is pretty much optional. You only have to tell Orkut what you want to tell it, and the visibility of what you tell it is controllable by defining when strangers/friends/etc can see... I'm thinking part of your paranoia is a misunderstanding of how the system works.

Al I have to say to is that if you are so unconfortable with Orkut, just get out, and don't be a part of the communite. I'm not trying to defend orkut or something, but I've found a lot o friends that i've not seen for many years and that is the power of orkut.. find or be together friends

I guess that make you unconfortable too... if you don't like don't try to finish with a whole ideia, that in my point of view is very good.

There are other reasons to be in jail. Some people say that people that "spam" a lot go to jail.
There are a link under the photo of any person that anyone can click. That link says report as bougus.
But I realy don´t know...

I have been playing around with Orkut a lot in the last 24 hours. One thing I don't understand about these Social Networking Platforms is why they ask for useless information and why they don't ask for the interesting things.

Example: Orkut gives me five large textareas to explain things like what I have learned from my past relationships. It lets me give Karma-Points to Phil Wolff if I think he is sexy. It lets me upload photos of my cat.

But it does not ask me if I have ever met Phil in person. (I have.) It does not ask me for how long I have known him. It does not distuinguish between "friend" and "acquaintance". 

It asks "Is xxx your friend?" and I am supposed to give a "thumbs-up" or a "thumbs-down". (And if I say "no" I cannot even add an explanation to that. I hope I haven't hurt anybody.) 

I don't get it. It would be so easy to gather this information and it would be so valuable. A simple "have met in person"-flag or something like "How often have you met X?" - "never - once - several times - often - meet regularly" would do it and give so much more depth to the network.

What is it that I am missing? Why is Orkut not gathering more data about the relationships of its members? (Like most of the information it could be optional - I bet many people would share it.) Please enlighten me.

i came across lifewithalacrity a while ago [6:20 pm GMT, Nov 18, 2004] while i was searching for answers regarding 'identity theft' on orkut after suffering a harrowing experince on that social networking site. i've been a member of Orkut for no more than 2 months now. i'm a journalist and work for a satellite tv channel in Pakistan. i have so far added 16 friends to my freind's list on Orkut who r either journalists, or celebrated singers, or tv actors/actresses in my country. this is the first ever social networking forum i've joined primarily becuase i have always had security concerns regarding privacy on other forums and because it was in affiliation with Google, offering a degree of reliability. throughout the time i have been a member of Orkut, i have sufferd loging and access problems on the site. there were times i culd not log into my account at all, or access my messages or access my friends. logging out was especially a major hassle becuase 8 out of 10 times i culdn't log out at the end of a session because when i tried to log out i got a messgae saying that the page i was trying to access was no longer available. i'd try a couple of times and then close the browser window which was always a source of concern becuase i use cablenet connection and remain apprehensive of leaving my account open and vulnerable on the network server if i dont log out. i duly reported all of this to the orket team via emails but all they ever sent me were automated replies telling me that due to the rapid expansion of Orkut these problems wuld come up especially since the software was beta. Today however i got a real shock when i logged into my account at about 1:15 pm GMT. There were horrible messages sent from account to all my freinds [scribbled on their scrapbooks mostly], messages like 'hey guys i am gay' and 'you suck!'. my user name and password to my account are known only to me. i dont knwo how someone got access to my account and sent these messages to all my freinds and made posts in my name on the communities i am a member of. 

my first instinct was to remove my account altogether from orkut. but then i thought that this was precisly what the malicious act was meant to do, to intimidate me ne and annoy me. 

but i am seriously not sure what i should do to ensure my id is not stolen again. any suggestions?

Some guy named Junaid from Karachi, Pakistan put up my cell no. on orkut in the call girls' list. I have been receiving countless phone calls from guys asking me how much i charge. This is pathetic because i don't even know any Junaid and i had never heard of this site till some guy called and told me that my cell no. was on display and so was my name under the call girl list.

BODY:
<p>In the last few weeks I've gotten more invitations to friends via <a href="http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=2789681602836776519">Orkut</a> then I have from all the other social networks I've tried out. I currently have 61 friends there (and they are all people I know reasonably well), whereas in several months I have only 50 connections in <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&amp;key=62844">LinkedIn</a>. Oddly, the number of friends I have in each of these is less the older they are. In <a href="http://www.ryze.com/go/ChristopherA">Ryze</a> I have 36, and in <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.Net</a> I have 32, and in my oldest FriendlyFavors, I have 5.</p>

<p>One good thing has come out of Orkut, I've found email addresses for some old friends that I thought I'd lost. Yet I am very frustrated by Orkut -- it made some minor user-interface improvements over some of the others, but fundamentally misses the boat. My biggest problem with Orkut is that it reveals far too much information -- do I really want to know that business associate Y is in an open marriage, or that X is gay and single? But that in some ways is minor problem -- the problem is that it appeals the "friend counter" evil angel on our shoulder, not to the "help me be a better member of my community" good angel.</p>

<blockquote>Perhaps it was inevitable. A backlash is under way against social networking services like Friendster, as more and more companies crowd to join the latest hot Internet trend. Sick of invitations to join networking services, and the constant nagging to validate friends or acquaintances, some people are turning against the ever-growing social networking services.</blockquote></p>

<p>Danah Boyd rants about Orkut in <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/venting_my_contempt_for_orkut.html">Venting My Contempt for Orkut</a> and uncovers a <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2004/01/30/orkut_pissyness_round_2.html">security hole</a> in it as well.</p>

<p>Right now only LinkedIn comes halfway to my expectations, and still has a long way to go. I still stand by my post of a month-and-a-half ago <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">Evaluating Social Network Services</a><br />
<blockquote>The Perfect Social Networking Service: My ideal service would have the the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affilations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryse, but less clunky. </blockquote></p>

<p>With so many others out there, they may all fail, and the good ideas that are hiding behind the bad will not survive.<br />

Very much on the same note, I wrote this entry (<a href="http://wetware.hjalli.com/000576.shtml)">http://wetware.hjalli.com/000576.shtml)</a> a few days ago. Since then however, I gave Orkut a chance - and it seems to far exceed the other systems in terms of features and above all ease of use. Sorry LinkedIn - Orkut is becoming the SNS (Social Networking System) of choice.

<p>For the last few weeks I've been moving my blog from Blogger Pro over to the TypePad service, after a frustrating try to get WordPress to work. While I was at it, I moved my blog from my business server to this new domain.</p>

<p>I finally have it all working here now, but all of my old permalinks are broken. In progress is a utility that will redirect people from the old permalinks to the new. I'll report progress on that later.<br />

BODY:
<p>At a recent unofficial gathering of <a href="http://finnern.com/future/">Future Salon'ers</a>, there was a discussion about a <a href="http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/2003/1218/sony_06.wmv">demonstration of four robots doing a japanese fan dance to music</a> (I think it was seen at CES in Las Vegas last week). The remark was that it was vaguely disturbing because your intellect knows that they are just robots, but someplace deep in your brain you know that they are alive because of the way that they move.</p>

<p>There actually a wonderful web page on this topic, called <a href="http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/glimpses/valley.html">The Uncanny Valley: Why Why are monster-movie zombies so horrifying and talking animals so fascinating?</a> by <a href="http://www.arclight.net/~pdb/">Dave Bryant</a>.</p>

<blockquote>(Japanese roboticist Doctor Masahiro Mori) is not exactly a household name — but, for the speculative fiction community at least, he could prove to be an important one. The reason why can be summed up in a simple, strangely elegant phrase that translates into English as "the uncanny valley".

<p>Though originally intended to provide an insight into human psychological reaction to robotic design, the concept expressed by this phrase is equally applicable to interactions with nearly any nonhuman entity. Stated simply, the idea is that if one were to plot emotional response against similarity to human appearance and movement, the curve is not a sure, steady upward trend. Instead, there is a peak shortly before one reaches a completely human "look"... but then a deep chasm plunges below neutrality into a strongly negative response before rebounding to a second peak where resemblance to humanity is complete.</blockquote>The topic of the "Uncanny Valley" has also come up recently in a column by the movie critic Rodger Ebert, <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/answ-man/sho-sunday-ebert11.html">Gollum stuck in 'Uncanny Valley' of the 'Rings'</a>, where he answers a question from a reader <i>"Should Andy Serkis, the actor of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, get an Oscar?"</i> where Ebert states:</p>

<blockquote>The genius of Gollum is that it seems like a convincingly real creature -- but not one we have ever seen before, so that its realism does not seem creepy except in the ordinary way. If Serkis brought Gollum to life, other artists fine-tuned the balance with the Uncanny Valley. So this is something other than a conventional performance, and should not compete against characters of a different nature. Perhaps a new category is called for? Beyond the Oscar of the Uncanniest Valley?</blockquote>I believe that the "Uncanny Valley" also applies to a number of other successes and failures in computer interface design. We loved <a href="http://www.bu.edu/jlengel/kn65kfs.mov">Apple's "Knowledge Navigator" video</a>, but in practice avatar-based systems have not been successful as they become a turn-off. Witness Microsoft's "Bob" and even Word's Paperclip avatar. When we see a little personality, a little "aliveness", we want a lot more, or it becomes annoying and we turn it off. However, the more "dead" it is, we are willing to forgive a lot.

<p>The "Uncanny Valley" also relates to my previous post <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/01/seven_fingers_o.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand</a>, as part of the art of a circus is entering and leaving the valley. As a contortionist amazes you she is entering the Uncanny Valley. As the the clown amuses you he is entering the valley. When they come back to earth and join the others, they are human again.</p>

I think you may have slightly missed the meaning of the uncanny valley with your contortionist and clown theory.

When the realisticness of a robot reaches a certain point, it reaches the uncanny valley and people suddenly feel extremely turned off to it.  It seems grotesque and unnatural, not entertaining.

BODY:
<p>Yesterday I watched the amazing <a href="http://www.les7doigtsdelamain.com/menu.html">Seven Fingers of the Hand Circus</a>. There were parts of it that were so beautiful and meaningful that I cried.</p>

<p>I decided to go because 2 of the 7 members have a history with the Bay Area "Pickle's Family Circus" which was a fabulous intimate circus that disbanded about 10 years ago. I loved the Pickles Family Circus because it was "human" -- I found Cirque de Soleil to be too cold and almost unhuman. What do I mean by this? Cirque de Soleil's acts have a tendency to try to be high art -- to divorce themselves from real people and become unemotional pure images of beauty -- even the clown acts seem a bit 'alien' to me. Every act of Pickle's, in contrast, was more human, with smiles and grunts and real emotions.</p>

<p>My favorite Pickle's act was a pixie-sized contortionist clown climbing all over a large barrel-chested MC. He would try to push her to the floor and she would keep climbing up on him such that he never succeeds. In spite of his size (and audience expectation) the big MC would do some acrobatic things that you didn't think a big guy like that could do. This would go on for 3-4 minutes, starting with frustration of the MC and the clowning pixie, and changing to their mutual appreciation of their differences -- the athleticism and largeness of the MC, and the flexibility and smallness of the pixie.</p>

<p>Seven Fingers of the Hand was everything that I hoped for, and more. When we arrived, we were led down the side of the theatre and all of a sudden I noticed that it looked like we were were all being led backstage. We curve around and all of a sudden see an entrance -- maybe 5 foot tall requiring most of us to duck. We duck through and to our surprise, we are have walked through a fridgerator, and we are on the stage!</p>

<p>One of the 7 players welcomes us, and another offers random people a glass of tea as we walk across the stage to our seats. The stage is set like a city loft, with a tv, some couches, a bed, a bathtub and shower, a kitchen, and of course the fridgerator we entered through. On the stage, and chatting to members of the audience are the 7 cast members, all wearing comfortable looking white shorts or athletic and white t-shirts.</p>

<p>The audience arrives over 30 minutes and the 7 players act as if we are guests of their loft, serving some of us tea, chatting, sweeping the floor, etc.  </p>

<p>Then as everyone is seated, a fabulous DJ (who besides being able to scratch can also sing and play various instruments) is introduced, and the show begins.</p>

<p>It is really difficult for me to describe the show itself -- there were over a dozen "acts" but they were all integrated together in such a way as to introduce the personalities and humanness of the players. I'll instead point you to these <a href="http://www.circuscenter.org/7Fingers/Reviews.htm">reviews</a> which describe it better then I can.</p>

<p>However, I can talk about what moved me -- first off, there was of course the beauty and athleticism of the players. In particular, there was the double 'tissu' act, a solo by the contortionist Isabele Chasse, hanging from two red silk curtain 20 feet above the stage, while the DJ played music on the theme of temptation.</p>

<p>Next there was the intimacy -- the Palace of Fine Arts is not a small theatre, but it felt intimate because of the way we arrived there and the way they treated us. Entering through the refrigerator door reminded me of the way you enter a Japanese tea house -- it requires to to humble yourself and bow to enter the new space.</p>

<p>Finally, there was a subtle theme, not at all obvious, of the 'teamness' of the 7 players. This included playfullness, creative conflict, minor jealousy, admiration, copying -- all as if the players lived in this loft together, like a cast of Friends. We were witness this artificact of their collaboration as if we were part of the collaboration.</p>

<p>I'm disappointed that they are leaving the Bay Area in a few days so that I can get all my friends to go, but I hope to see them the next time they return to the Bay Area and will drag all of my friends along.</p>

While looking for show tickets for a present I accidentally found out this troupe is actually from Montreal and doing shows home these days. Went to see the show yesterday. They're indeed excellent! I think two of the original creators are no longer in the show, though.

A number of people came in late and entered together about 10min into the show through the fridge door as Patrick (the short, comic guy) was standing on top of it. Coming in on the stage is already disorienting, but seeing them being welcomed by cast members mid-act under the spotlights with everyone else sitting was delightful.

<p><a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/12/23/bloggers_block_collapsing_facets_and_the_number_150.html">Joi Ito's Web: Blogger's block, collapsing facets and the number 150</a> offers some insights on two different topics:</p>

<p>The first is on the nature of identity when we write in our blogs:<blockquote>"The depth of my identity is becoming shallow because the context has collapsed."</blockquote>I have a lot of sympathy with this but from a slightly different perspective -- I have so many different 'identities' of who and what I am and what I'm interested in that it makes it hard for a stranger to be able to understand me if I try to cover it in one blog. Yet without those other identities I am not truely 'whole'.</p>

<p>Joi attributes this collapse of context due to the size of groups:<blockquote><a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0114726/2003/02/12.html#a284">Ross Mayfield broke the networks down</a> into political, social and creative at 1000's, 150 and 12, but my feeling is that the political layer is 10's of thousands and next layer is business at 500 and social at 150 and creative at 12. This is not scientific, but just my personal observation. If this is true, this blog is approaching the political layer which explains why I feel that I get more business done on LinkedIn, but I feel much more candid and happy on IRC and Chat and why I still really love dinner conversations most of all. I think that if you can manage the audience size and composition on your blog, you can tune it to any of these layers.</blockquote>I'm also convinced that the nature of the size of groups affects the group dynamics of those groups, and your relationship with others in those groups. I may disagree on the exact ranges of sizes (my observations map the creative team/family/committee 5-9, tribe/clan 25-81, association 125-300 (note the gaps)) but the I agree with the basic principle.</p>

<p>Shannon Appelcline's <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_.shtml">"Trials, Triumphs & Trivialities"</a> column in the <a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/">Skotos Articles section</a> recently featured a trilogy of articles about stretching the bounds of socialization in online games:</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_136.phtml">Social Gaming Interactions, Part One: A History of Form</a></b></p>

<p>The first article outlines the problem by looking out how social interaction has traditionally been handled in online games, and by considering how limiting these interactions typically have been. It also outlines how to expand traditional social interactions by describing three main categories of social interaction: competition, cooperation, and freeform.<blockquote>That the majority of MMORPGs, MUDs, and other multiplayer games ultimately support achiever players over socializers, or even killers, I think begins to outline how poorly we understand--and support--true social interactions in today's multiplayer games.</blockquote><b><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_137.phtml">Social Gaming, Part Two: Competition</a></b></p>

<p>The second article expands upon the competitive category of social interaction. Besides touching upon traditional direct competition, it also considers resource competition, economic competition, and the role of bluffing in competition. A number of examples are drawn from tabletop board games.<blockquote>In looking at competitive interaction I intend to first consider some forms of competitive interaction that we've sort of covered--direct competition and resource competition--but will show how even in these "well known" interactions we've just scratched the surface. Afterward we'll get into some less explored possibilities: economic competition and bluffing. The end result? More variability in competition, more viability and for the players, ultimately, more fun.</blockquote><b><a href="http://www.skotos.net/articles/TTnT_138.phtml">Social Gaming Interactions, Part Three: Cooperation & Freeform</a></b></p>

<p>The third and final article expands upon the other two categories of social interaction: cooperation and freeform. Within cooperative interaction we find a spectrum of possibilities varied by the immediacy of the cooperators. Freeform interaction is given a more generalized overview, covering some of the reasons it appears and how to encourage it.<blockquote>In Richard Bartle's categorization of multiplayer gamers, he very broadly touches upon "socializers"--players who are there because they want to interact not just with the game system, but also with other people. I actually believe there's a lot more granularity to the category of socializers than just its simple name. The biggest subset of socializers is, I believe, the cooperative players--those who are working together within the game system toward a specific goal. A few different MMORPGs have tried to appeal to this group, but as with competitive gamers there's also more we can learn from the word of tabletop games.</blockquote>My personal belief is that the so-called "socializer MMPORGs" -- Sims Online, There, Second Life, etc. -- have missed the boat by not really understanding the socializer, or treating them like they are achievers. If someone can figure out how to break out of that trap, there may be a new hugely successful MMPORG game opportunity available.</p>

BODY:
<p>I've received a number of replies and pointers after posting my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">Evaluating Social Network Services</a> here last Tuesday. Here are a few:</p>

<p><b>Invite Issues</b></p>

<p>Esther Dyson writes in her blog about invite issues for her favorite social networking service in <a href="http://release4.blogspot.com/">Some Comments on LinkedIn</a>:<blockquote>I am getting a lot of invitations from people I don't know. It would be great to have a button that says "See inviter's profile" that links directly from the confirm-or decline-invitation page.</p>

<p>Also, on the invitations page, the service should include some advice: "Do not invite people who do not know you. If you are not sure, at least give them a hint of who you are ... how you met, etc. If you are not sure or that effort is too much work for a particular person, perhaps you do not know that person well enough." </p>

<p>My sense is that people are starting to invite everyone in their address book. That may goose statistics, but the key is the signal, not the noise. ANd, of course, too much noise will drown out the signal.</blockquote>In <a href="http://www.ginx.com/%7Epierre/archives/000104.html">Pierre's Web</a>, Pierre writes that he is having issues with the amount of spam-like messages he recieves from LinkedIn when the lauched the service to upload your outlook address book:<blockquote>I've been getting too many of these e-mails. Since I haven't used this new 'feature' of LinkedIn, I don't know if these messages are automated or manually triggered. They all have the same text, so they seem automatic. I've decided I'm going to decline or ignore these unless I get a personal note. Roughly 1 out of 3 comes from someone whose name I recognize. But people I know well don't send me these -- they send me direct invitations.</blockquote>In <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/">Werblog</a> Kevin Werbach comments on both Esther & Pierre's issues at <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2003/12/13.html#a1336">When is a Connection Not a Connection</a>:<blockquote>(The) problem is that the social networking services don't have a field for "do I really know this individual personally?"  Having someone's email address in Outlook isn't necessarily a proxy for a relationship.  Yesterday I got a request through Spoke to forward an invitation to Paul Krugman, the New York Times columnist.  I knew both the sender and the next person in the chain, and the request was reasonable, so I forwarded it on.  The recipient wrote back to say that his only link to Krugman was sending him one email last year commenting on a column.  Krugman never responded.  Not exactly a "trusted connection."</blockquote><a href="http://www.iunctura.com/_justinhitt/">Justin Hitt</a> wrote me an email in response to my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">evaluation blog entry</a>:<blockquote>You also address an important issue that the degree of a relationship is important -- (for example) I'd like to connect with you through LinkedIn, but we only know of each other. While we have a mutual connection of Thomas Powers -- I don't know anything about your challenges as a business owner.</p>

<p>Of course, when I update my address books with people I've interacted with in the last 30 days, you'll automatically become a part of my network. The real importance of this type of pseudo-relationship is that it's turned into something. Either I have to provide value to you, or you to me, or together to another party.</p>

<p>Perhaps the perfect system would let me assign a degree of relationship strength (like the Spoke system)-- you'd start as a 1, but over time could be upgraded to a 10 if we are of value to each other.</blockquote><br />
<b>Differing Values of Networks</b></p>

<p>In <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/">Werblog</a> Kevin Werbach continues in the same blog posting an important observation about <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2003/12/13.html#a1336">the differing values of a social network</a>:<blockquote>Pierre Omidyar and Esther Dyson both complain about getting spammed by invitations through business-oriented social networking services such as LinkedIn. <br />
....<br />
(The) most connected people need them the least.  Esther and Pierre don't need LinkedIn to reach pretty much anyone they want to contact.  Yet there are a whole lot of folks who want to reach them, and don't have a personal connection to do so.  So the service worsens their email overload with little corresponding benefit. I'm somewhat in the same boat.  I'm certainly not as well-known as Esther and Pierre, but I have a pretty good network in the tech industry.  I haven't yet found a situation where LinkedIn got me to someone I couldn't reach directly, by Googling for an email address, or by guessing a mutual connection.</blockquote>Mike on TechDirt further supports this issue in <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031215/132222_F.shtml">Social Networking Services Brings Out Critics</a>:<blockquote>I was part of a company that tried to build just such a solution in the 90s, and we discovered that people who have valuable rolodexes realize there's value in keeping those rolodexes private. They're not comfortable with handing them out. At the same time, the people who most need to use such a service are those with the fewest connections. In other words, social networking services are often a system for subsidizing the poor networking skills of the unconnected with the strong networking skills of the well connected. The people who are the most valuable to the system only end up with more spam from random people trying to reach them.<br />
<font size=-2 color=green>(This quote was originally mis-attributed (pointed to an aggregator) -- this has been corrected.)</font></blockquote><br />
<b>Endorsement Issues</b></p>

<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon Udel </a> writes in <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/12/16.html#a870">The LinkedIn dilemma</a>:<blockquote>Here's what stopped me from writing an endorsement for somebody on LinkedIn today: the requirement to define our relationship as one of these choices<br />
...<br />
The same kind of thing stopped me from joining the identity-badge party at the Digital ID conference recently. I'm bugged by forms that invite or require me to specify the unspecifiable.<br />
...<br />
I understand the impulse to codify social protocols in software. I'm not at all sure we can do it in ways that preserve the necessary fluidity and fuzziness. But there's VC money in them thar hills, so I guess we're going to do the experiment and find out.</blockquote>Mike on TechDirt writes in <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20030917/1141243.shtml">The Social Networking Bubble Gets A Bit More Hot Air</a>:<blockquote>I never got a chance to ask my question about whether some of these "explicit social networking" systems can actually cause harm to real social connections. While both Friendster and LinkedIn claim that since you approve your connections, you guarantee that they're people you "endorse". However, that makes it sound like a binary decision. If they're in your network, you endorse them. That's not true.</p>

<p>Let's say I want to contact a hotshot at a big company, and see that he's connected to a friend of mine. What if (a) that friend is getting so many requests to have people introduce him to the hotshot and (b) he thinks that introducing me to that hotshot will harm his relationship with that hotshot. Instead, he's now harmed his relationship with me, because now I know, explicitly, that he doesn't want to introduce me to someone.</p>

<p>Sometimes things are better left unstated, and some of these social networks are going to discover these problems as they expand. Already, I've heard of people trying to figure out what to do about people they don't like adding them to their Friendster network. You don't want to turn down people and insult them, but each of those connections makes the whole thing less valuable.</blockquote><br />
<b>Understanding Customers</b></p>

<p><a href="http://www.iunctura.com/_justinhitt/">Justin Hitt</a> has an interesting take that social networking software has more value then establishing new contacts, in his blog <a href="http://iunctura.com/weblog/2003/12/17.html">How I use social software for stronger business relationships</a> (reg required) :<blockquote>Right now I'm primarily using these interactions to study the usefulness of such mediums.  It seems a lot of people just want to chat about things and the real decision makers aren't in the systems.  At times I'm convinced that social software is a tool of the unproductive, until I met more serious business networks like LinkedIn and Spoke.</p>

<p>Like any community you only get what you put in.  The relationship strategies I share here apply in social software environments.  I've gained new clients and business partners through each network, but that's not my primary interest of participating.  In fact, you should only have one reason of accessing these environments, that one reason is to...</p>

<p><i>Connect with existing customers to make sure you satisfy their every desire.</i></p>

<p>I've learned more about my existing customers by taking this final step.  After focusing on my area of expertise, creating a profile, and seeking to provide value -- I have created more return by using social software to improve the relationships I already have.</blockquote><br />
<b>Explicit Connections</b></p>

<p>Related to Justin's comments above, at <a href"http://www.ratcliffeblog.com">RatcliffeBlog</a> <a href="http://www.ratcliffe.com/About.htm">Mitch Ratcliffe</a> writes in <a href"http://www.ratcliffeblog.com/archives/000074.html">Social Networking Deconstructed</a> about problems with a Spoke referral not working, and adds:<blockquote>At the same time, what is interesting about the social networking technology is that it forces requests into a semi-public venue, making us think about them more explicitly. I'm not sure that does much in terms of making successful connections today, though it certainly makes the "pain" social networking software hopes to address more explicit.<br />
...<br />
It remains to be seen if the social networkers will get the capital to learn these lessons, but I am hopeful that they will succeed. In the meantime, it is clear to me that the more purposeful the networking service offered, the more successful it will be in satisfying users' expectations. If anything, the social networks today are suffering from a lack of clarity about what they offer, so that all sorts of crazy expectations, like the idea that relationships will become frictionless, get lathered onto the term "social networks."</blockquote>Social Software researcher <a href="http://www.zephoria.org">Danah Boyd</a> writes in <a href="http://www.zephoria.org/snt/archives/001374.html">comment</a> to the above article:<blockquote>I love social networks. They are a part of all of our daily lives and i'm in awe of the sociologists who have dedicated themselves for so many years to figure out how people negotiate them. But as more and more technologists take on the social networks meme, they continue to mutate the concept and thus destroy much of the underlying theory that relies on certain fundamental ideas about interaction.</blockquote>I have this concern as well -- technologists (and coders, cryptographers, economists, and mathematicians) have a habit of taking small trends or behaviors and mapping them identically at all scales, big and small, past and future. Or another way to describe it, they see a tool like a stick of dynamite and want to use it to drive nails and travel to mars. I expect that we don't know enough about social software dynamics to understand how it works at different scales.</p>

<p><b>Usefulness of Social Network Services</b></p>

<p>Mike on TechDirt writes in <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20030605/0258223.shtml">It's All about Who You Know</a>:<blockquote>It certainly seems like there's a trend to create these types of online "meet markets" for business or for pleasure. Why am I not impressed? First, I remember a similar company from a few years back called sixdegrees.com that had a ridiculous amount of hype before eventually folding. It turns out that many people have fun entering in the names of their friends at first - but very quickly lose interest. No one updates their lists, and no one does much beyond a little poking around. It's fun to see who your friends know, but most people aren't comfortable asking friends to be put in touch with their other friends. While it is a core part of networking, these systems often feel like spying on just who your friends' friends are.<br />
...<br />
The biggest thing is that the people you know in your network have tremendous value to you. Most people don't like to give up their rolodex. They know it's valuable, and they want to keep it in a position where they can leverage it - and not have to worry about random people (even if they know them) sniffing through it. They don't mind making introductions when they think it makes sense, but they get annoyed when someone approaches them and asks them to make an introduction. Also, there is much more value to me, if someone I know introduces me to someone because they thought it would be good if I knew that person. Any time I got an introduction through a system like LinkedIn, that connection would immediately have lower priority, because I would think that the person trying to contact me specifically tried to track me down - rather than the person linking us realizing that we should talk. </blockquote><a href="">Scott Loftesness</a> wrote me back after my <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2003/12/evaluating_soci.html">evaluation</a> yesterday to say:<blockquote>As it turns out, I've not actually used LinkedIn much.  A couple of weeks ago -- after signing up for the service months ago -- I got bored on a weekend and went in to look at it again.  I found some folks (through just searching for financial services folks) that I knew.  I sent them invitations, etc.  Probably sent out a total of 40+ invitations (you included).  All but a few of those invitations were acceptance -- and my network jumped to something over 60 as a result.</p>

<p>In terms of actually using the service, I've yet to use it for anything productive for me.  I've responded to exactly two introduction requests -- being in the middle of a five party chain to get from originator to receiver.  Both looked legit -- and I passed both on and it looks like they've been forwarded all the way to the receiver.</p>

<p>I've got LinkedIn enabled so that browsing members can contact me directly.  I've received one inquiry via that route -- but it was way off my subject matter expertise so I just responded saying so.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, in the last 2-3 days, I've had 2-3 requests to join other people's LinkedIn networks -- after going for many days in between earlier invitations.</blockquote><br />
<b>Other Services</b></p>

<p>There are quite a few other services that I haven't explored yet, like Spoke Software and Zero Degrees, and there are other software or services like Contact Network, InterAction, Plaxo, Skype, Eurekster, Tickle, MeetUp. I hope to take a look at a few of them and report back soon. I don't think that I'll be looking at the dating sites such as Match.com, American Singles, Yahoo Personals, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com">InfoWorld</a> has an article by <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/columnists/ephraim_reality.html">Ephraim Schwartz</a> called <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/12/15/49NNsocial_1.html">"Social Networking Targets the Enterprise"</a> that says that corporations are looking to use social networking service features in their CRM (customer relationship management) software. They mention a couple of companies that will be offering this, Contact Network, Interface Software, Spoke Software, and ZeroDegrees.<blockquote>For example, the ZeroDegrees dashboard would allow a person in furniture sales to be alerted when a large company leases more space or places ads for employees, thus indicating expansion and the need to furnish new office space, said Jas Dhillon, CEO of ZeroDegrees.<br />
...<br />
Other vendors ramping up their capabilities include Spoke Software. Next year the company will add a hosted service to its current on-premise solution. Spoke claims it has doubled the size of its relationship base from 5 million to 10 million people a user can access. <br />
...<br />
Law firm Honigman, Miller, Schwartz, and Cohn used Interface Software's InterAction suite to land lucrative accounts, according to Cynthia Reaves, partner at the firm. "We use InterAction to strategize about how to approach a client and develop teams of people to approach a potential client on a particular matter," Reaves said. </p>

<p>Interface is unique in that its social networking capability is a single feature in a complete CRM application for the professional services industry. It also uses outside content from companies such as Dun & Bradstreet and Hoover's to extend and improve the quality of potential contacts.<br />
...<br />
"Companies like Siebel and Salesforce.com are watching this space. These social networking companies will be gobbled up real quick," Pombriant said. </p>

<p>Pombriant believes the two exceptions are Interface Software, which offers a full CRM product, and perhaps ZeroDegrees, if it can deliver on its promise of extending its capabilities out to sales intelligence. </p>

<p>Social networking as a phenomenon is helping CRM improve the speed of closing a deal, but with a different twist, according to Pombriant. "We are no longer interested in buckshotting the marketplace to do indiscriminate selling. Social networking is trying to identify the best opportunity and people to pitch those opportunities to," Pombriant said.</blockquote>It will be interesting to see how this intersection of CRM, sales support software, and social network services will play out. At least there is a decent business model here.</p>

BODY:
<p>After a week where I met a number of bloggers and social network / social software people, I decided to try to update my various networks at <a href="http://www.ryze.com/">Ryze</a>, <a href="http://www.tribe.net/">Tribe.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="http://www.friendster.com/">Friendster</a>.</p>

<p>These are my observations of these social network services after a few weeks of work.</p>

<h3>Overview of Social Network Services</h3>

<h4><a href="http://www.ryze.com/go/ChristopherA">ChristopherA @ Ryze</a></h4>
This was the first social network service that I signed up that seemed to already have some of my friends on it. At the urging of <a href="http://www.henshall.com/blog/">Stuart Henshall</a> I put a little more effort into it and got a half-dozen connections. After last week, when I met more social software people in person, and a bunch of link requests, I now have 22 'friends'.

<p>Ryze has the clunkiest interface of the four major social network services -- your personal home page starts with a two column profile that is professionally oriented, but has difficulty if you have more then one affliliation. Below this standard profile you can use some HTML to create a better looking section, but for non-HTML users it is difficult. Finally, the page ends with a Guestbook, which other other service members can post comments in.</p>

<p>One of my favorite features in Ryze is that when you click on a friend or potential friend, it shows you all the connections that you have between yourself and that person through your friends and friends of friends. Some of course will be obvious (as you run the the same circles) but sometimes you will find a completely different connection than you anticpated. Related, once you sign in the site home page will show you small pictures and first names of various friends of friends, and you'll sometimes recognize some of them and ask them to join your network.</p>

<p>A clunky feature, but one that shows promise, is that when you see another person's profile, you can reveal selectively your business phone number, your email address, your home phone, or your cell phone. You can do this for anyone individually, or you can set rules such that friends automatically get some of this  information.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting things about Ryze is its orientation toward having physical gatherings, such as parties. There various events going on every week. As they charge for many of these events, thus Ryse has sort of a business model. I've not attended any parties yet, but I've been told by at least one professional that she has gotten business from them.</p>

<p>Besides the clunkiness of the interface and your personal home page, the worst thing about Ryze is that it is a little too open by default. To add someone as a friend takes a single click, and you get no opportunity to say why someone should join your network. Though that makes it easier to add people, on the recieving side I ended up with a number of people who wanted to add me as a friend when I had no idea who they were. The other level of openness is the guestbook -- I suppose it is supposed to serve as a combination of introduction and endorsement, but in practice it is almost spam. Guestbook entries are automatically visible, and you have to go through a clunky interface to hide them.</p>

<h4><a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub,pcard,PeopleCard.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">ChristopherA @ Tribe.Net</a></h4>
Tribe.Net was the second service I signed up for, and I currently have 24 friends.

<p>The name of this service exemplifies what I like most about Tribe.net -- by design you have multiple affiliations, or tribes.Each tribe has a message board, so 'intentional communities' is an important part of this service.  In fact, this site almost hides your professional information, putting it under a secondary tab, but unfortunately, this tab also only allows for one affiliation per member.</p>

<p>Another unique thing about Tribe.Net is the classified listings -- you see on various pages listings of requests and to a lesser extent offers from your social network.</p>

<p>The biggest weakness with Tribe.Net is that it lacks the ability to personalize very much. Your personal home page is mainly lists, and thus your personalization is largely limited to your photo.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile?viewProfile=&key=62844">ChristopherA @ LinkedIn</a></h4>
LinkedIn is the most professional looking of all the social networking services that I've looked at so far, and is very oriented toward your professional network and not your broader personal network. In fact, unlike almost all the other sites, LinkedIn doesn't allow for you to add a photo your your personal page. I currently have 20 "connections" (they don't call them friends).

<p>My favorite part of LinkedIn is that it has a very good resume engine. Basically you put in all of your recent job history, with dates, and the software displays it in a form that looks a lot like a resume. This is the only social networking service that I've found so far that lets you have multiple current professional affilations, which for me is important. Unfortunately, this site does not allow you to easily list your non-professional affiliations, nor does it allow for you to separate job-type affilations with lesser type affiliations like 'investor', 'member of professional association', etc.</p>

<p>An important strength and weakness to LinkedIn is that it is much more protective of your privacy. You can't add anyone to your network unless you know their name and email address, or you have to get a referral from someone who is already your friend. This makes this service much more professional respectable then the other social networking services, which are more casual. For busy and well connected people like <a href="http://release4.blogspot.com/">Esther Dyson</a> this is very important.</p>

<p>I've only recently joined LinkedIn, so I haven't had a chance to use it's requests feature yet, but in at least the area of Venture Capital, it seems quite powerful. When I searched on this I got over 500 people that were somehow connected to my social network that I might be able to ask a friend for an introduction to.</p>

<p>The biggest weaknesss of this site is that it tries to be completely self-contained. It doesn't let you list your website, blogs, or give out your personal information selectively like Ryse does. The only external information that it allows you to share is your email address, and that only to friends.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=4608201">ChristopherA @ Friendster</a></h4>
This is the most recent social networking service that I have joined. Designed originally for dating, I had not played around with it as I'm in a long-term relationship. However, after hearing <a href="http://www.danah.org/">Danah Boyd</a> talke about it her blogs, I realized that it has evolved beyond that.

<p>The nicest thing about Friendster is its simplicity. There are 13 entries to fill out, ranging from gender to favorite movies. Unfortunately the site has become a bit over-popular with the under-25 crowd lately, so it can be very slow in the evenings. Because it was a dating site, the photo links are important, and the actual photos show up larger on this site then they do on any other site, making your photo on your personal page even more important.</p>

<p>The biggest weakness to Friendster is also that simplicity -- it is not oriented toward professional connections, nor to your group affiliations. It is just about you and your immediate friends. This makes Frienster the most "status" oriented of the various sites. It becomes more important to see how many friends you have, and how many endorsements you can get.</p>

<h4>Others</h4>
The first social networking service that I ever tried was Friendly Favors, now Living Directory, which I am at <a href="http://www.livingdirectory.org/display/my_profile.php?PHPSESSID=c029fc94040c8bd88ec39e3e8e4dacef">ChristopherA @ LivingDirectory</a>. However, I've never been able to find many of my associates already on this system. This site was oriented toward the idea of trading favors and has a heavy non-profit orientation. But without being able to find people that I know already signed up, it hasn't worked for me. One obstacle that I had when I first joined, which may have gone away, was that you needed a sponsor to join.

<p>A site that is not normally considered social networking software, but I believe should be is LiveJournal, where I am <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/christophera_/">ChristopherA_ at LiveJournal</a>. This is primarily a blog site, however, because other LiveJournal members are the only ones allowed to post comments on your site, and there is a "friends" link that shows the top entries of your friend's LiveJournal sites. This results in some of the behaviors that I've seen on Friendster and Ryze happen at LiveJournal.</p>

<h3>Barriers of Entry</h3>
The first barrier of entry to these social networking services is they require reasonably significant effort and time to get started.  In the case of Ryze, they have a clunky user 'home' page that you have to take time to fill out. Tribe is a bit easier then Ryze. LinkedIn is relatively easy if you have a resume handy. Friendster is the easiest to fill out (provided you already have a decent picture) and relatively easy to find friends.

<p>A second barrier of entry is that it often takes at least one person with a large existing network before many of the features of the service start being useful. In my case with Ryze and Tribe.Net it was <a href="http://www.henshall.com/blog/">Stuart Henshall</a>, and with LinkedIn it was <a href="http://www.loftesness.com/radio/">Scott Loftesness</a>. With LinkedIn, this was particularly important, as you can't even search for people who you don't have 3rd degree connection with an existing friend -- once I added in Scott I could find lots of people that were on my other networks.</p>

<p>The third barrier of entry is signing up people to your network:</p>

<p>The easiest signups are those that already members of the network. Each of the 4 services have different advantage and disadvantages for signing up existing members of the network:<br />
<li>Ryze search allows you to search all members, not just friends of friends. The search is fairly simple, just first name and last name, but you must do them all individually. You get a result which is a very small photo and first and last initial -- in some cases it can be difficult to figure out if it isn't a false-positive, but in most cases it is enough that you can tell. However, when you request to add someone you don't get an opportunity to include in the request message <b>who</b> you are and <b>why</b> you wanted them to join your network.<br />
<li>Tribe.Net also allows you to search by first and last name, and it will search all members, not just friends of friends. Like Ryze you must search individually. However, it does allow you to personalize your request to join.<br />
<li>LinkedIn has a nice feature where you can upload your Outlook address book, and it can find matches of people where the name and email address match and you can ask to invite them. However, once you've exhausted these immediate connections, LinkedIn is harder to add new connections to existing members. First, you must have at least found one person in your Outlook address book who is well connected, or your searches will fail as searches only work through friends of friends. Next, when you find other people, you must enter their email address, and if you don't have it (or can't find it on the net) or if it is different, then you must request an invite by way of that friend of a friend. Of course, you don't want to bother your friends with these requests, so often you will not do so.<br />
<li>Friendster allows you to search by first and last name from the entire network, however, the searches can sometimes be extremely slow. Like Ryze, you can't put a note in to say who and why you want to link to them.</p>

<p>The hardest signups are to those who are part of your real-life personal network, but haven't signed up for any of these services. First, you risk being perceived as a spammer if you don't invite each with a personally crafted invitation, and if they do sign up, you feel an obligation to get them going because otherwise their use of the service will be clunky. All of this means that I have invited very few people to join these services that were not already signed up.</p>

<p>Lastly, a big barrier is that all four of these services rely on endorsements of one nature or another. This takes time, and involves some emotional and personal exposure. A poorly written endorsement reflects on both you and the person you are endorsing. Asking for endorsements is an expenditure of personal relationship capital that you need to be careful of. Related, do you endorse people who have endorsed you?</p>

<h3>Barriers of Maintenance</h3>
One you have joined one of these services, you really need to maintain it. This means updating and improving your personal pages, searching for people that have joined and adding them to your friends lists.

<p>One odd ongoing problem that I have is, upon receiving a request, evaluating who I should allow to be a 'friend' -- if I discriminate too much my network will be small. I was much less discriminating when I first joined Ryze, and there are a few people that are on my 'friends' list that I really don't know. Part of this problem is the nature of these links. My ideal would be that there were at least two levels, acquantaince and friend.</p>

<h3>Barriers of Usefuless</h3>
With all the effort it takes to join and start these services, as well as the ongoing effort it takes to maintain them, ultimately there has to be a payoff in some utility. This can be in new friends or contacts, or new business, etc.

<p>At this point I'm not sure that for me that it will be worth the effort. Maybe that is because I'm fairly good at networking to start with, and secondarily because I don't want to overspend my personal relationship capital on frivolous stuff. Maybe if I didn't live in the bay area where many of my contacts are already based, or if I had some more immediate needs, such as looking for a VC to pitch to on LInkedIn, or to party with Ryze members, or to invite people to join an intentional community on Tribe.</p>

<p>Another part of the problem is that there are a number of these sites, and they seem to have a lot of the same people. Maintaining more then one and synchronizing your contacts across multiple services is very difficult. If there was one site that everyone was on and offered the best of all the features, I'd consider dropping all the others.</p>

<p>Related, if everyone doesn't discriminate who they choose as friends, the functionality of these sites may break down, or just become popularity contets.</p>

<h2>The Perfect Social Networking Service</h2>
My ideal service would have the the multiple professional affiliation features of LinkedIn, but also allow me to show non-professional affilations. It would allow me to form intentional communities like Tribes.Net, but would also let me do a Wiki in addition to a message board. It would have meeting/party invite services like eVite, and blogging features like LiveJournal. It would have an endorsement system like LinkedIn integrated not only with professional endorsements, but personal endorsements as well, and you could even endorse intentional communities. It would let me better map and control my network, giving different friends different privileges. It would handle the release of my personal information like Ryse, but less clunky.

It may be time to refresh this post by adding some of the more recent self-sufficient social networks driven not by explicit affiliations but by patterns of behavior.  These networks have the potential of growing much faster due to the low maintenance required on the user side.

The problem with these social networking sites is that to get any benefit out of them you have to spend hours a day on the sites.

Perhaps intentionally, you left out Care2Connect, http://Care2.com/connect. It's got a decided liberal activism bias but, given that, its a great social and dating network and you can include professional input as well.

Great article otherwise!

<p>I've been interested for several years in the ability of "player-generated content" to create niche or small multiplayer online games, at a company I've invested in called <a href="http://www.skotos.net">Skotos </a>. At this point its oldest game Castle Marrach is completely run by the players, and 7 more games are being developed by their customers. The company is at break-even, but is not yet a 'commercial success'. There are some learnings from the world of massively multiplayer online games that apply to other kinds of social networks.</p>

<p>Some of these learnings have to do with size of groups -- different sizes of teams and groups in games can have very different effects, both positive and negative. I've never seen any Social Software that innately understands that a team of 7 behaves very different then a clan of 50 or a megaclan/tribe of 350. These behaviors have parallels to size of mailing lists, online communities, and even to the size of corporations. If Social Software can integrate an understanding of this then it might be significantly more successful</p>

<p>I'm also interested in what I call "social games" for online games. I don't believe that current MMPORGs serve well what the industry calls the 'socializer', which consists of 15% of current gamer population, but may in fact be much higher if you include women who don't currently play as many online games. Two recent articles that I've been collaborating with Shannon Appelcline on this topic:<br />

BODY:
<p>I have been working the last couple of weeks on a business plan idea for a company tenatively called eVentor: <blockquote>eVentor is a unique event marketplace that brings together event producers and attendees to dynamically create, staff, and people events of all types--from concerts and performances to reunions and seminars. It does so by using the power of smart contracts to arrive at joint consensus and by acting as a single clearing house for the entire process of event creation, from earliest negotiations to final registration.</blockquote>The key thought with eVentor is similar to that of eBay -- eBay has reduced the barriers of entry for a small business such that people can now do new ventures starting entirely from their own home. It has done this by creating a huge marketplace and by acting as a trusted third party that individuals and small companies can fully particpate in. This has resulted in hundreds of thousands of new "micro-businesses", some of which of which have grown substatially in size.</p>

<p>What eVentor wants to do is similar -- lower the barriers of entry for small events, whether a seminar, a concert, a dinner meeting, a family reunion, etc., lowering it to such a level that people who could not afford to manage the complexity of small events before can do so now do so in order to make new "micro-businesses".</p>

<p>At this point the idea has just myself behind it -- call it an "entrepreneur-in-residence exercise". I will be running this business plan by a few possible contributors and/or partners in the next few weeks, as well as investigating partnerships with some of the new social software companies that don't have a business model. Ultimatately I plan to present this business plan to a couple of Angel Investors and VCs in January.</p>

<p>A followup to my post yesterday <a href="#107108853847658748">Social Software -- Problems & the Definition of "Friends"</a>, I saw in <a href="http://www.sjl.us/main/2003/12/social_networki.html">Scott Lofteness' blog</a> a reference to David Hornick's <a href="http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000214.html">VentureBlog: Conserving Social Capital</a>:<blockquote>As social networking software grows more prevalent and an increasing number of people attempt to draw upon our social capital to make introductions, entertain business propositions, pass along resumes, etc., I believe we will all grow more guarded with our time and our relationships. If social capital is indeed capital, we will all soon be more careful about where we spend it and on whom.</blockquote><br />
Scott also mentions his own experience with Social Software:<blockquote>I'm finding there's just not much of a "there there" for me. Nothing that draws me back to regular usage. Somehow expanding LinkedIn's view of my network just doesn't get me excited -- like they think it should! There's certainly nothing there I'd be willing to actually pay LinkedIn for!</p>

<p>This obviously isn't a stable situation. Something will likely emerge to make this a more useful service -- a place to spend and share the social capital David talks about -- or it'll eventually just fade away.</blockquote>Yet it is interesting that all of us are giving it a real try. There may still be a 'there' there, but if it is, it is currently being obscured.</p>

BODY:
<p>In September I signed up for <a href="http://www.vonage.com">Vonage</a>, a VoIP (Voice-over-IP) service that using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) that allows you to connect using the net to the analog POTS (Plain Old Telephone System) quite economically.</p>

<p>I've had for a while a Cisco VoIP phone that is connected to the <a href="http://www.pch.net/">PCH</a> (Packet Clearing House) experimental <a href="http://www.pch.net/inoc-dba/">INOC-DBA Phone Hotline</a>. This is a private telephone network for the internet that directly connects to internet operators and sysadmins at various ISPs and hosting sites, allowing them to communicate and share problems. I've been very pleased with the quality of the connections -- if anything, better then POTS in most cases.</p>

<p>Given the quality of the Cisco VoIP phone, I thought it worth investigating to see if I could justify a VoIP system for Alacrity and closely related companies like Skotos, but discovered that hosting our own Cisco-based system would probably be too expensive. Then I heard about Vonage.</p>

<p>Vonage offers unlimited local and regional calling and 500 minutes of US/Canada calling for $24.99 a month -- however, in addition to this I get complete "class 5" telephone services, which includes voice mail (which can be emailed to you), call forwarding, caller ID, etc. -- with my local service SBC/PacBell I was paying over $44 a month just for services, not any calling charges. Just the voice mail forwarding to my email is almost worth the price that I'm paying for the line.</p>

<p>When I initially investigated I was concerned what would happen if my net connection was down, and was pleased to find that they have a feature such that if the net connection was down the phone would forward to another line. This could be an analog land line or to a cell phone.</p>

<p>My other reservation was that Vonage would not work with my existing Cisco VoIP phone -- instead they send you a dedicated Cisco box that you then attach your normal analog POTS phone to. I can understand why they do this -- having only one kind of hardware to deal with makes tech support easier, and allowing people to use their existing POTS phones would make it easier for unsophisticated customers.</p>

<p>I decided to experiment by transfering one of my business lines -- I have moved my office in Berkeley to a home office in Kensington, and I've been paying $0.01 a minute to transfer calls as SBC/PacBell would not let me move the phone line here. So I was paying for 2 lines, one in Berkeley and one in Kensington plus $0.01 minute, so obviously switching to Vonage would save me money.</p>

<p>I had the Vonage working in a couple of days -- I just have it down in my machine room connected to my ethernet switch, and from there connected to my regular building analog phone wires. It worked great, but my pre-existing number was not working with it yet, just a temporary number from Vonage. Several months later the number was finally transferred -- not Vonage's fault, but SBC/PacBell's, who made it very difficult to transfer.</p>

<p>Now that it is all installed I'm finding it quite convenient. Also, I'm finding has some long-term advantages. If I go for an extended trip, and if I have a net connection, I can just bring the small Cisco box and a phone with me and I can call and answer my own phone line wherever I may be. I can even go overseas and my US telephone number can still work. While I'm disconnected, Vonage will forward my calls to my cell phone.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep trying it for a few more months, and it continues to have the quality that I need, I will probably move all but one emergency unlisted analog phone line to Vonage. That is all my lines - fax, home, business, etc. This will give me the ultimate in portability.</p>

<p>They also now have for existing customers a "soft" VoIP client that works on your computer or laptop. I may try that soon as well.</p>

<p>If you are interested in trying out Vonage, they have a special offer where if I refer you they'll give us both 1 free month of service. I have to send you an email to trigger it, so if you are interested send me an email.</p>

We have experimented with VoIP software since 1992 -- and, of course, nothing worked well until recently.  A consultant friend mentioned that he takes his Vonage box when he travels in the US and Europe so he can answer and make calls using his L.A. phone number.  I recently converted one POTS line to Vonage and the quality is good, the features are great, and we're saving money.  Vonage should do well with this combination.

BODY:
<p>I've been playing around with a number of so-called Social Software/Social Networking sites for about six months.</p>

<p>I'm currently on <a href="http://new.ryze.com/view.php?who=ChristopherA">Ryze</a> with supposedly 13 'Friends' and 414 in 'Network', and <a href="http://cluster.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/template/pub%2Cpcard%2CBasics.vm?personid=ce34093a-3c72-4954-b52f-3d6bc51884af">Tribe.net</a> with 20 'Friends' and 17,677 in my 'Network'. I've registered for a few others, but wasn't able to get them going much beyond registering. However, I have not registered for Friendster yet, as it was originally a dating site but I understand now that it is more then that.</p>

<p>These Social Networking sites have been interesting, but so far none have been a really useful to me.  </p>

<p>I've identified a few problems:</p>

<p><li>Getting started can be difficult -- you have to either invite a bunch of your own friends (which can be tacky) or you have to find an acquaintance who is has already collected a number of people as their friends and join with them.</p>

<p><li>You also have to be faithful to updating your local home page, and I for one have too many home pages.</p>

<p><li>There seems to be some cache to have lots of network 'Friends', however, I'm really uncomfortable with that. There is often a 'tit-for-tat' that goes on that is "I'll add you as a friend if you'll add me". But I'd rather name them something different then a friend. In fact, a number of people that I have as 'Friends' are people that I'd rather name as 'Aquaintances', as maybe I've met them once or twice in person, typically at an event where we didn't have any in-depth interaction.</p>

<p><li>Last, but probably most important -- I'm not getting enough value from them for the effort. I do have a friend that say that she has gotten good business from it, but I think that is more because she is a single woman and because she attended some live events sponsored by the social network. Maybe my problem is that I'm a decent networker by myself, and don't need the extra help of the service?</p>

<p>All that I've joined feel just a bit off -- but yet I still believe there is something useful in Social Software to learn that I just have to puzzle out.</p>

<p>As a user-interface designer in the 80's for companies like Apple Computer, and as old 'groupware' professional in the early 90's, I've been quite disappointed with how design of collaborative apps appears to have practically ceased since the introduction of the web.</p>

<p>It is not that there haven't been lots of new features added in the last 10 years, it is that they are often too complex, or are pure eye-candy and not particular useful. I'm a believer in elegance and I've not seen much of it lately.</p>

<p>However, I saw in in Slashdot today that IBM has some web pages demonstrating a <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/index.html">prototype email client</a> which I find quite elegant at first glance.</p>

<p>A very interesting <a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/level2.cfm?resource=musicrisk1">article</a> that has a different take on why the tussle of people who file share vs. the Music Industry. What I like is that it is taking a "behavioral economics" approach to understanding the problem.<br />
<b><a href="http://www.bubblegeneration.com/level2.cfm?resource=musicrisk1"> <br />
The New Economics of Music: File-Sharing and Double Moral Hazard</a></b><br />
<blockquote>Every major label 's setting up an iTunes these days. They're all, in the immortal words of Johnny Cash, 'born to lose, and destined to fail'. Why? The music industry doesn't understand the microeconomics of it's own business. If it did, it would see that it's business model is not just misguided, but broken--because, DRM or not, the implicit contract it signs with listeners is being broken in both directions.</blockquote><br />
The key paragraph in this article is:</p>

<blockquote>The point is this: the net offers listeners insurance against the music industry itself. File-sharing isn't simply theft. Rather, file-sharing is risk-sharing - against an industry with the freedom to undertake hidden action in the extreme, and not live up to the contract it has written. Remember, the contract said that labels would assume the risk in exchange for dollars from listeners - so when moral hazard lets labels try and push risk to listeners, is it any surprise that listeners try and minimize it by parceling it out? In fact, we could go even further - saying that file-sharing is a way for principals to punish agents operating under extreme moral hazard, with the hope of bringing the agents incentives into line. </blockquote>

The gist of the article is that file-sharing is a form of risk-sharing by music consumers.  While that's an interesting argument could it be that the writer has "over thought" this issue?  It seems to me that it is more likely that file-sharing has become so prevelant for no other reason than it can be done.  

I suspect we all know people who spend several hours a day on-line downloading everything they can get their hands on.  This type of indiscriminate acquisition of copyrighted material has nothing to do with risk-sharing.  These people wouldn't be buying everything they download in the first place.

We live in a "something-for-nothing"  society and large-scale file-sharing is simply an outgrowth of that.

If one wants to argue the implicit contract between the music industry and the consumer it is important to remember that consumers have always, and will always, have the opportunity to vote with their wallets.  If laying out $18 for a new release CD is too much to risk on an unknown performer, stealing the material is not a reasonable or acceptable remedy.  Perhaps it would be if the thief regarded it as a "purchase on approval" and would pay if the quality was up to the listener's standards.  But that's not the case.  It's my guess that very few CDs are purchased because the consumer stole it and liked it.  After all, what would motivate anyone to pay for something that had already been obtained free of charge?

There is an argument that runs contrary to the writer's which says that consumers have plenty of opportunity to mitigate their purchase risk ahead of time.  Brief "preview" versions of many, if not most, of the songs on new CDs are readily available from on-line sellers.  It certainly doesn't require any more investment of time or resources to listen to those previews than it takes to download the album.  

The only real risk-sharing going on here is the hope that if enough people file-share often  enough it will be too difficult to police and no one will have to face any consequences.

I have my doubts regarding this system for big projects, but for well defined projects of under $5-10K, so far I highly recommend it.</p>

Of course supporting the global economy. USA products are sold everywhere in the world, therefore world products should be sold in USA as well. This is what globalization is about.
We run a website similar to elance, called SupportUniverse. Cheaper prices and better after-sale service.

<p>At this point it is just a trivial application -- it just lets you edit remotely a single page. I'm trying to slowly add in elegant features without compromising on this projects essential simplicity. Longer term goals are focused around trying to figure out better solutions for the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RefactoringWikiPages">RefactoringWiki Problem</a>, which might include such future features as proposals, voting, different commenting techniques, different versioning, etc. There is no specific commercial goal with this project, it is open source.</p>

<p>Game Designer and Pundit <a href="http://www.costik.com/">Greg Costikyan</a>: wrote in his blog a thought I can't believe that I've not heard of before, it makes so much sense. But it is new to me:<blockquote><a href="http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003_10_01_blogchive.html#106720019248778019">Games * Design * Art * Culture</a>: "Oh.... And you fellas. Sure, I like portraying the angry, um, middle-aged man... But, yet, I understand the importance of capital in bringing a product to market. But think about it: Back in the day, capital provided four essential things: development funding, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution. In the digital era, manufacturing is trivial; distribution is less of an issue; marketing is, if anything, harder; and for most products (not games or film), development is easier and cheaper. Under the circumstances, isn't a realignment of the percentage of revenues due to artists a vital necessity? They =should= get a bigger piece of the pie. And since manufacturing is trivial, and development easier, the whole thing should be cheaper to consumers.</p>

<p>And whoever figures out how to market effectively online is going to be worth.... well, more money than I shall ever see in one place."<br />

<p>I have been hesitating on committing to <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> because ever time I check into availability of Blogger Pro, it was not available. Apparently now <a href="http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/pro_email.pyra">Blogger Pro is Free</a>.</p>

<p>My remaining concern is that the <a href="http://new.blogger.com/feature_giveaway/announcement.pyra">new feature list</a> for Blogger Pro does not mention RSS syndication at all, nor does it mention if it will be available in the future. There is a help item for for Syndication, however, it refers to a "Site Feed" tab on my settings panel, and that item is not available.</p>

<p>If RSS syndication is not available soon, I will likely switch to some other software, in spite of the ease of Blogger Pro.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/">Scott McCloud</a>, a very smart comic book artist and author of the fantastic book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/006097625X/qid=1057279163/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-4032771-8576750?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">"Understanding Comics"</a> has been trying for a number of years to both <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0613280407/qid=1057279250/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-4032771-8576750?v=glance&s=books">reinvent comics</a> but also has been <a href=http://www.scottmccloud.com/comics/icst/index.html>experimenting</a> with how the medium of the Web transforms the comic medium. In addition, he has been an advocate for exploring new business models for comic book artists.</p>

<p>A few years ago he strongly advocated micropayments, however, none of the many attempts at micropayments in the 90s have taken off. In his latest comic <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/comics/trn/intro.html">The Right Number</a> he has teamed up with <a href="http://www.bitpass.com/learn/">BitPass</a>, a new micropayment company that opened just this month.</p>

<p><b><i>Review:</i></b> I deposited $10 for BitPass cash, paid through PayPal which pulled it through my Amex as BitPass doesn't itself accept Amex (quite convoluted, but it worked). Nothing very intrusive was asked of me. I paid $0.25 to Scott to view his comic, and again, nothing too intrusive was asked of me, and getting to the paid comic site was painless.</p>

<p>The online comic "The Right Number" itself was not bad -- Scott McCloud continues to stretch what can be done with the online medium. Not quite as good or innovative as <a href="http://www.brokensaints.com">Broken Saints</a> but interesting. The story was provocative, and I look forward to the rest of the chapters of the comic before I can really give the story a complete review. But so far it is certainly worth $0.25!</p>

<p><b><i>Commentary:</i></b> I've been closely involved but not quite an "insider" in the micropayments area for quite some time. I did consulting for David Chaum of DigiCash fame, and one of my former board members (and now a blogger) <a href="http://www.loftesness.com/radio/">Scott Loftesness</a> later took over that company as CEO and sold it, and as far as I can tell it has been dead since. Cybercash was one of my first SSL-Plus customers, and though they still exist, they are no longer in the micropayments arena. First Virtual who could have been a competitor of PayPal died because they didn't embrace SSL tried to buy my firm, but later went bankrupt. Quite a few interesting micropayment cryptographic protocols and business models have crossed my desk when I was CTO of Certicom, and later as an angel investor.</p>

<p>Thus I think I really understand how a difficult a business micropayments is to be in.</p>

<p>I figured that PayPal effectively now owned the low end of payments, primarily because they were business-model centric first, security centric second, and not at all cryptographic centric (they use SSL). I think many of the other companies were too cryptographically purist and this was the source of their downfall. In particular DigiCash, which had real promise but killed it by over hyping anonymous transactions when that wasn't really wasn't what the consumers wanted. PayPal succeeded because they were not purist -- they just made the business model work.</p>

<p>BitPass is doing the right thing so far -- their process is simple, and bootstraps of the trust that people already have for PayPal and credit cards. I don't know how difficult it is to set up for if you are an information provider -- I've got some ideas on how to make this easer, but it will never be simple. But I don't know what approach they are taking -- are they hosting? Do they provide scripts? Do the scripts run on both Linux and Windows servers? The BitPass website has nothing on these topics yet.</p>

<p>I think the biggest risk for BitPass is that the barriers of entry for companies like PayPal to enter this market are very low, so if BitPass can prove that the need for micropayments has finally arrived, it will be very easy for PayPal to drive BitPass out of business.</p>

I'm very interested in the idea of micropayments ($1 to $2) to sell "printable" versions of my how-to articles from my Web site. I realize that it needs to be quick and painless for people to bother paying for this content.

I've discovered the micropayment secret rates for Paypal (2.9% + 5¢, I think) and it works for me. But I really wish BitPass were still in business. It would automatically give access to the downloadable files. Instead, I've had to create a convoluted rule-based system in my e-mail app to send the download link when payment is received. Not only is this insecure, but it requires that my e-mail application be up and running to process the requests.

Do you have any additional information about this topic that you can point me to? I think micropayments are a good model for electronic publishing. The fee is low enough for anyone to afford, and those with a conscience will be more likely to pay than to pirate. Would love to see what you think after all these years have gone by.

<p>I decided after years of reading blogs that it was time to start blogging.</p>

<p>Why Blogger? I wanted an easy web interface, but also I wanted it hosted on my site (which is <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> based). A couple of blog tools offer this. I wanted something really simple and I didn't want to host my own tools (keeping my own TWiki's up-to-date has been a pain) so I wanted the tools hosted elsewere. I also required that the remote tools used a secure connection to my server -- Blogger uses SFTP.</p>

<p>But the clincher was the new <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a>.</p>

<p>My only SNAFU so far is that I've got my new <a href="http://twiki.alacritymanagement.com/bin/view/Kitchen">Kitchen TWiki</a> working to send and receive RSS, however, the signup for <a href="http://pro.blogger.com/">Blogger Pro</a> has the note "Blogger Pro ordering is currently offline while we retool. Sorry for the inconvenience. Please check back next week."</p>
